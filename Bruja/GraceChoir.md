# Bruja Grace Choir Support (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Low (7/15) – grace upkeep is simple, and careful HP pacing keeps the 12-floor run comfortable.
- **Win condition**: stack Grace via `Cabrit sans Cor`, `Ill Intent`, and `Mercy Plea`, then spend it on draw/mana bursts (`Insolence`, `Haruspicy`) while allies close fights.[1][2][3][4]
- **Best in**: backline support; you buff allies, feed cards, and stabilize HP with `Healing Drops`.
- **Key stats**: `Mercy Plea` grants Grace whenever you lose 5+ HP—paired with `Insolence`, you can draw 4 cards and gain mana every other turn.

## Core Loop
1. Gain Grace through kill triggers (`Cabrit sans Cor`, `Ill Intent`) or HP payments (`Adjourn`, `Libation`).[1][2][5]
2. Spend Grace using `Insolence`/`Haruspicy` to draw cards, recover mana, and keep your hand flowing.[3][4]
3. Support the team with `Cover`/`Ward Off` equivalents and convert excess Grace into finishing blows with `Mind Fracture` or `Corrupt Offering`.

## Draft Priorities
- **Grace generators**: `Cabrit sans Cor`, `Ill Intent`, `Mercy Plea` influence, `Libation` for HP-to-Grace conversion.[1][2][5][6]
- **Grace spenders**: `Insolence`, `Haruspicy`, `Embrace Ire` (later) for mega draws/mana.[3][4][7]
- **Survival tools**: `Leeches`, `Sangria`, `Ward Off` for healing/block while you pay HP costs.[8][9]
- **Finishers**: `Mind Fracture` or `Malevolent Glare` to capitalize when Grace is high and bosses are exposed.[2][10]
- **Removals**: cut high-risk blood cards if HP is unstable; the build prefers controlled HP spend.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Insolence` (extra draw), then `Cabrit sans Cor` for higher damage/Grace gain.[1][3]
- **Hideout**: remove redundant attacks, Plan `Cabrit sans Cor`, and funnel gems until `Mercy Plea` or other artifacts appear.[11]
- **Vaults**: visit once Grace engine stable so you can pick supportive artifacts without risking HP early.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Mercy Plea` – automatic Grace on HP loss; cornerstone of the build.[6]
- `Red Beads` – heals allies when you take HP costs, perfect synergy with blood cards.[12]
- `Finger Guillotine` – +1 max HP per fight offsets Grace-related self-damage.[13]
- `Golden Onion` – passive regen keeps you above dangerous thresholds.[14]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Gain Grace first, then spend with `Insolence`; never empty your Grace pool unless you’re about to refill it immediately.[3]
- Keep HP between 50–70%; many cards scale off missing HP, but you need buffer for unexpected hits.[2]
- When `Mercy Plea` is active, plan to spend 5 HP on Adjourn/Libation each turn to gain Grace without risk.[5][6]
- Time finishers (`Mind Fracture`) for when Grace is high and allies have already softened targets.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Blood | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Cabrit sans Cor` ×2 | 1 / – | Grace generator | Kills add +4 Reckoning + Grace.[1]
| `Ill Intent` | 1 / – | Single-target generator | Higher damage + Grace on kill.[2]
| `Insolence` | 0 / – | Grace spender | Draw 2 when Grace active—upgrade early.[3]
| `Haruspicy` | 1 / Rare | Mana/draw | Converts Grace into cards + mana based on Reckoning.[4]
| `Adjourn` or `Libation` | 0 / 2–3 blood | Grace + Reckoning | Use when Mercy Plea ensures replenishment.[5]
| `Mercy Plea` | 2 / Legendary | Influence | Auto-grace on HP loss; vital if found.[6]
| `Leeches` / `Sangria` | 0 / 1–2 blood | Sustain | Provide Healing Drops to recover paid HP.[8]
| `Ward Off` | 1 / – | Block | Safeguards while you set up Grace loops.[9]
| `Mind Fracture` | 2 / Legendary | Finisher | Cash in high Grace/Reckoning for lethal blows.[10]
| Flex slots | — | — | Utility | `Malevolent Glare`, `Tongue Bite`, or ally-support cards depending on drops.[10]

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Insolence` + `Haruspicy` combo draws 4+ cards and nets mana, enabling big finishers every other turn.
- `Mind Fracture` deals 10 (15 when upgraded) plus Reckoning, letting you close bosses once allies chip them down.[10]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Call out when you have Grace to spare so allies can plan burst windows; your draw spells refill their hands too.
- Maintain `Ward Off` for boss phases—your self-inflicted HP loss means you need consistent block.
- During add waves, use `Insolence` to dig for removal; then set up `Mind Fracture` on the boss while the team handles adds.

## Common Pitfalls
- Burning Grace without a plan; always keep at least 1 stack for emergency draw.
- Overusing blood-cost cards without `Mercy Plea`—HP can dip dangerously low between heals.[6]
- Forgetting to upgrade `Insolence`; base draw 2 may be insufficient late-game.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
