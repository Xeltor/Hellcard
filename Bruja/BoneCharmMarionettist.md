# Bruja Bone Charm Marionettist (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: animate foes with [`Puppeteer`][card-puppeteer], spawn disposable allies via [`Bag of Bones`][card-bag-of-bones]/[`Wendigo`][card-wendigo], and recycle their deaths into power using [`Trick Death`][card-trick-death] and [`Soul Swap`][card-soul-swap].
- **Difficulty**: Medium (10/15) – positioning summons and timing trades takes practice.
- **Best in**: co-op midline; provides crowd control while allies focus bosses.
- **Key stats**: [`Puppeteer`][card-puppeteer] forces enemies to attack for you, while [`Bag of Bones`][card-bag-of-bones] summons blockers that feed [`Trick Death`][card-trick-death] refunds on demise.

## Core Loop
1. Summon skeletons with [`Bag of Bones`][card-bag-of-bones], [`Bone Broth`][card-bone-broth], and [`Wendigo`][card-wendigo] to clog lanes.
2. Charm priority enemies using [`Puppeteer`][card-puppeteer]/[`Malevolent Glare`][card-malevolent-glare] so they waste turns attacking each other.
3. Cash in fallen minions with [`Trick Death`][card-trick-death], [`Soul Swap`][card-soul-swap], and [`Bone Knitting`][card-bone-knitting] for mana, cards, and healing.

## Draft Priorities
- **Summon suite**: [`Bag of Bones`][card-bag-of-bones], [`Wendigo`][card-wendigo], [`Bone Broth`][card-bone-broth]; upgrade Bag first for sturdier skeletons.
- **Charm/control**: [`Puppeteer`][card-puppeteer], [`Malevolent Glare`][card-malevolent-glare], [`Ill Intent`][card-ill-intent] keep elites busy.
- **Recycle tools**: [`Trick Death`][card-trick-death], [`Soul Swap`][card-soul-swap], [`Bone Knitting`][card-bone-knitting], [`Work Life Balance`][card-work-life-balance] profit from deaths.
- **Removals**: drop direct damage spells; the summons and charms do the heavy lifting.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: [`Bag of Bones`][card-bag-of-bones] → [`Puppeteer`][card-puppeteer] → [`Trick Death`][card-trick-death] upgrade path.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Bag of Bones`][card-bag-of-bones], remove redundant bile cards, and buy artifacts that spawn minions ([`Bag of Bones`][card-bag-of-bones] variants, [`Teeth Necklace`][card-teeth-necklace]).
- **Vaults**: helpful—legendary summons like [`Wendigo`][card-wendigo] appear more often.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Bag of Bones`][card-bag-of-bones] (artifact) – extra skeleton each combat adds cannon fodder.
- [`Teeth Necklace`][card-teeth-necklace] – boosts skeleton damage when they hit enemies.
- [`Inner Well`][card-inner-well] – extra mana to cast summons and charms in the same turn.
- [`Salt Circle`][card-salt-circle] – protects summons by adding block while casting rituals.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Charm first, summon second: charmed enemies will kill your skeletons for refunds.
- [`Trick Death`][card-trick-death] should follow big summon waves to recoup mana immediately.
- Keep [`Soul Swap`][card-soul-swap] as emergency heal/redeploy if an ally is about to fall.
- Co-op: coordinate lane assignments so allies don’t accidentally kill your charmed targets early.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Puppeteer`][card-puppeteer] ×2 | 1 / Rare | Charm | Controls elite actions. |
| [`Bag of Bones`][card-bag-of-bones] ×2 | 1 / Common | Summon | Upgrade for sturdier skeletons. |
| [`Wendigo`][card-wendigo] | 2 / Rare | Elite summon | Huge HP blocker. |
| [`Bone Broth`][card-bone-broth] | 0 / Common | Extra summon | Free fodder per turn. |
| [`Trick Death`][card-trick-death] | 0 / Rare | Refund | Draw + mana when minions die. |
| [`Soul Swap`][card-soul-swap] | 1 / Rare | Heal + summon | Saves allies and restarts summons. |
| [`Bone Knitting`][card-bone-knitting] | 0 / Common | Sustain | Trigger off minion deaths for heals. |
| [`Malevolent Glare`][card-malevolent-glare] | 1 / Common | Stun/charm | Backup control when Puppeteer misses. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Work Life Balance`][card-work-life-balance], [`Ill Intent`][card-ill-intent], or artifact brews. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- Charmed elite + skeleton swarm converts 15+ enemy damage into friendly fire per round.
- [`Trick Death`][card-trick-death] after two skeleton deaths refunds 2 mana and draws 2 cards.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Use summons to body-block boss projectiles; charm adds extra boss self-damage.
- Keep [`Soul Swap`][card-soul-swap] for ally clutch saves—switching HP can prevent wipes.
- Notify team before charmed units die so they finish off other threats first.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to reposition; charmed enemies still move if lanes open.
- Overspending mana on summons without [`Trick Death`][card-trick-death] backup leaves you exposed.
- Killing your own skeletons early—let enemies do the work to trigger refunds.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
