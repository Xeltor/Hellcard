# Bruja Hexstorm Channeler (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: rapidly build Reckoning with `Hex`, `Malevolent Glare`, and `Cabrit sans Cor`, then unleash `Channel Wrath`/`Veer Anger` to wipe sections.[1][2][3][4]
- **Difficulty**: High (12/15) – balancing HP cost, Reckoning stacks, and bile penalties across 12 floors demands careful sequencing.
- **Best in**: frontline caster who controls enemy waves with explosive AOE once Reckoning climbs.
- **Key stats**: `Malevolent Glare` adds +10 Reckoning in one cast; two casts followed by `Veer Anger` deals massive medium-cone damage capable of clearing Act III packs.

## Core Loop
1. Stack Reckoning using cheap hits (`Hex`, `Cabrit sans Cor`, `Ill Intent`) while controlling HP with healing drops.[1][4][5]
2. Detonate with `Channel Wrath` (small-radius) or `Veer Anger` (medium-radius) when stacks reach 20+.[2][3]
3. Rebuild using Grace/bile tools (`Adjourn`, `Tongue Bite`) so you can repeat the loop every other turn.[6][7]

## Draft Priorities
- **Reckoning builders**: `Hex`, `Cabrit sans Cor`, `Malevolent Glare`, `Ill Intent` – they ramp quickly.[1][4][8]
- **Payoffs**: `Channel Wrath`, `Veer Anger`, `Adjourn` (for Grace + Reckoning), `Embrace Ire` for mega draw.[2][3][6][9]
- **Support**: `Ward Off`, `Leeches`, `Forewarn` manage HP loss; `Insolence` converts Grace to draw when prepping bursts.[5][7][10]
- **Optional**: `Liturgy of Pain` or `Humoric Attune` if Black Bile falls into your lap, but keep focus on Reckoning core.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Hex` (adds extra damage/Reckoning) then `Veer Anger` for bigger AOE; follow with `Ward Off` for safety.[1][3][5]
- **Hideout**: remove off-theme cards, Plan `Hex`, and invest gems until you can buy supportive artifacts (`Mercy Plea`, `Red Beads`).[11]
- **Vaults**: useful once the engine is online; pick artifacts that offset HP loss or boost Reckoning.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Mercy Plea` – Grace on HP loss ensures `Insolence`/`Haruspicy` always trigger.[12]
- `Red Beads` – heals allies when you self-damage, helping co-op teams.[13]
- `Black Affinity` – block every time you draw Black Bile if you fold in bile tools mid-run.[14]
- `Finger Guillotine` – raises max HP to survive the long campaign.[15]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Lead with `Cabrit sans Cor` to gain Grace before finishing with `Channel Wrath`—the extra Grace fuels next turn’s `Insolence` draw.[4]
- Hold `Veer Anger` until you hit at least 20 Reckoning; the Strain makes premature casts inefficient.[3]
- Use `Adjourn` only when you can survive the bile/HP cost; follow with `Tongue Bite` to heal and draw.[6][7]
- Coordinate with allies so they strip block before your detonation; your payoffs hit harder on clean targets.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Blood | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Hex` ×2 | 1 / Common | Reckoning ramp | Upgrade for +5 damage and faster stacks.[1]
| `Cabrit sans Cor` | 1 / Common | Grace + Reckoning | Kill to secure Grace for draw engines.[4]
| `Malevolent Glare` | 1 / Rare | Burst stack | Adds +10 Reckoning, enabling huge detonations.[2]
| `Channel Wrath` | 0 / Common | Small-radius payoff | Use when stacks reach 20+.[2]
| `Veer Anger` | 0 / Rare | Medium-radius payoff | Strain—plan mana/HP before casting.[3]
| `Adjourn` | 0 / 2 blood | Reckoning spike | Adds bile + Grace; follow with healing.[6]
| `Insolence` | 0 / Common | Draw | Spend Grace for cards/mana set-up.[7]
| `Ward Off` | 1 / Common | Block | Keep HP stable while stacking.[5]
| Flex slot | — | Utility | `Tongue Bite`, `Embrace Ire`, or bile payoffs as needed.[7][9]

## Damage Benchmarks
- 25 Reckoning → `Veer Anger` hits for 25 in a medium cone (50 over two casts with Strain if mana allows).
- `Channel Wrath` nukes 20 HP elites once stacks cross 20, letting you reserve `Veer Anger` for waves.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Call Reckoning levels so allies know when to stall; one more stack often converts into a wipe.
- Keep `Ward Off` ready for boss thresholds; use `Channel Wrath` on spawn waves, saving `Veer Anger` for main phase.
- Allies can feed Grace (via heals) so you’re never short on draw or mana pre-det blast.

## Common Pitfalls
- Triggering detonation too early; under 15 Reckoning wastes the payoff.
- Forgetting bile penalties after `Adjourn`; always heal before the next draw step.
- Running out of mana—track Strain on `Veer Anger` and rotate payoffs.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
