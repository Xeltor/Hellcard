# Bruja Blood Reckoning Spiral (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: stack **Reckoning**, cash out with `Channel Wrath`/`Veer Anger`, and stabilize with `Healing Drops` or Grace triggers.[1][2][3][4]
- **Difficulty**: high – you juggle HP thresholds, blood costs, and grace timers, but payoff turns erase entire waves.
- **Best in**: frontline or midline when the party can feed block; Bruja thrives on taking controlled chip damage.
- **Key stats**: Each Reckoning stack translates directly into damage; `Adjourn` converts HP loss to +150% Reckoning with Grace, enabling 80+ damage nukes by Act II.[5]

## Core Loop
1. Build Reckoning with cheap attacks (`Hex`, `Cabrit sans Cor`, `Ill Intent`) and blood skills (`Adjourn`, `Anoint`).[1][5][6]
2. Maintain survivability by cashing in Grace for draw (`Insolence`), adding `Healing Drops` from `Leeches`/`Sangria`, or using block sources like `Ward Off`.[7][8]
3. Detonate Reckoning with `Channel Wrath`/`Veer Anger`, then immediately rebuild using blood-cost skills while allies patch you up.[2][3]

## Draft Priorities
- **Reckoning builders**: `Cabrit sans Cor`, `Ill Intent`, `Malevolent Glare`, `Adjourn`. These scale quickly and fuel Grace loops.[1][5][6]
- **Payoffs**: `Channel Wrath` (small radius) and `Veer Anger` (medium radius); pick both if possible for coverage.[2][3]
- **Support skills**: `Ward Off` for block, `Anoint` for blood + draw, `Insolence` to cash Grace into cards.[7][9][10]
- **Emergency buttons**: `Bloodletting` influence to convert HP to cards/mana if your draw bricks; `Cauterize` line for sustain via artifacts.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Channel Wrath`/`Veer Anger` early to increase their base damage; follow with `Ward Off` or `Cabrit sans Cor` for better scaling.[2][7]
- **Hideout**: remove low-impact starters (`Nick Jugular`) once Reckoning engine is online; use **Plan** to pin `Adjourn` or `Ward Off` for consistent setup.[11]
- **Vaults**: visit only when HP is comfortable; the build already spends life aggressively, so avoid extra risk before locking in Grace payoffs.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Chirograph` – rebuilds your deck around `Adjourn`, `Anoint`, and `Channel Wrath`, giving a turbo Reckoning start.[12]
- `Suturing Needle` – adds `Bag of Bones`/`Ward Off` mix for safer early turns if you need more sustain.[13]
- `Finger Guillotine` – +1 max HP per battle offsets blood payments and self damage.[14]
- `Red Beads` – turns your HP bleed into party healing; great in co-op where allies benefit from your sacrifices.[15]
- `Silver Spoon`/`Clam` – standard gem economy; invest early so you can afford the 1-gem Bruja artifacts and Armory upgrades.[16][17]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Track HP thresholds: many attacks gain bonus damage below 60–80% HP; plan blood costs to stay in the sweet spot without dying.[1][6]
- Use `Leeches`/`Sangria` before big Reckoning detonation to stockpile `Healing Drops` for recovery.[4]
- Fire `Channel Wrath`/`Veer Anger` after stacking Reckoning; these cards strain, so reserve mana or HP for follow-up turns.[2][3]
- `Ward Off` and `Grace` let you survive counterattacks; stash Grace for `Insolence` draws only when you’re safe.[7][10]
- Communicate in co-op: allies can finish low-HP enemies to prevent accidental overspends of blood cards.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Blood | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Leeches` ×2 | 0 / 1 blood | Sustain | Deals chip damage, adds `Healing Drops` to hand.[4] |
| `Cabrit sans Cor` | 1 / – | Reckoning + Grace | Kills add +4 Reckoning and Grace for draw/burst.[1] |
| `Adjourn` | 0 / 2 blood | Reckoning spike | Converts HP lost into +150% Reckoning and Grace; adds `Black Bile`.[5] |
| `Hex` | 1 / – | Stack builder | +3 Reckoning in small radius; bread-and-butter AOE.[1] |
| `Ill Intent` | 1 / – | Single-target builder | +6 Reckoning + Grace on kill; solid on elites.[6] |
| `Channel Wrath` | 0 / – | Payoff | Deals damage equal to Reckoning; Strains, so plan mana.[2] |
| `Veer Anger` | 0 / – | Payoff | Medium-radius Reckoning detonation; Strains.[3] |
| `Ward Off` | 1 / – | Block | Reliable block to cover blood turns.[7] |
| `Insolence` | 0 / – | Grace cash-out | Spend Grace to draw 2, keeping engine running.[10] |
| Flex slot | Varies | Utility | `Anoint` (blood draw), `Necrotize` (missing HP burst), or movement for positioning.[9] |

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Channel Wrath`: at 25 Reckoning → 25 damage AOE ×2 when Strain repeats; aim for 30+ before Act II elites.[2]
- `Veer Anger`: same scaling but wider cone; costly in HP if you mis-sequence due to Strain.
- `Ill Intent`/`Cabrit`: kills grant +6/+4 Reckoning; chain kills to climb quickly.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Share sustain responsibilities: teammates should feed block/artifacts so you can stay in the Reckoning sweet spot.
- Call out when you’re ready to detonate; allies can chip enemies down without stealing kills needed for Reckoning stacks.
- Boss phases: keep `Ward Off` ready before Strain turns; use `Adjourn` after a burst to restock Reckoning + Grace for the next cycle.

## Common Pitfalls
- Overspending blood when below 30 HP – always keep a `Healing Drops` or ally heal lined up.
- Casting `Channel Wrath` with low Reckoning; wait until you have at least 15–20 stacks for value.
- Forgetting Strain on payoffs; back-to-back casts spiral mana/HP costs if you’re not prepared.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
