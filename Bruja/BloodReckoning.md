# Bruja Blood Reckoning Spiral (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: stack **Reckoning**, cash out with [`Channel Wrath`][card-channel-wrath]/[`Veer Anger`][card-veer-anger], and stabilize with `Healing Drops` or Grace triggers.
- **Difficulty**: High (13/15) – HP/blood juggling is demanding, yet payoff turns erase waves even late in the 12-floor run.
- **Best in**: frontline or midline when the party can feed block; Bruja thrives on taking controlled chip damage.
- **Key stats**: Each Reckoning stack translates directly into damage; [`Adjourn`][card-adjourn] converts HP loss to +150% Reckoning with Grace, enabling 80+ damage nukes by Act II.

## Core Loop
1. Build Reckoning with cheap attacks ([`Hex`][card-hex], `Cabrit sans Cor`, [`Ill Intent`][card-ill-intent]) and blood skills ([`Adjourn`][card-adjourn], [`Anoint`][card-anoint]).
2. Maintain survivability by cashing in Grace for draw ([`Insolence`][card-insolence]), adding `Healing Drops` from [`Leeches`][card-leeches]/[`Sangria`][card-sangria], or using block sources like [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off].
3. Detonate Reckoning with [`Channel Wrath`][card-channel-wrath]/[`Veer Anger`][card-veer-anger], then immediately rebuild using blood-cost skills while allies patch you up.

## Draft Priorities
- **Reckoning builders**: `Cabrit sans Cor`, [`Ill Intent`][card-ill-intent], `Malevolent Glare`, [`Adjourn`][card-adjourn]. These scale quickly and fuel Grace loops.
- **Payoffs**: [`Channel Wrath`][card-channel-wrath] (small radius) and [`Veer Anger`][card-veer-anger] (medium radius); pick both if possible for coverage.
- **Support skills**: [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off] for block, [`Anoint`][card-anoint] for blood + draw, [`Insolence`][card-insolence] to cash Grace into cards.
- **Emergency buttons**: `Bloodletting` influence to convert HP to cards/mana if your draw bricks; `Cauterize` line for sustain via artifacts.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Channel Wrath`][card-channel-wrath]/[`Veer Anger`][card-veer-anger] early to increase their base damage; follow with [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off] or `Cabrit sans Cor` for better scaling.
- **Hideout**: remove low-impact starters (`Nick Jugular`) once Reckoning engine is online; use **Plan** to pin [`Adjourn`][card-adjourn] or [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off] for consistent setup.
- **Vaults**: visit only when HP is comfortable; the build already spends life aggressively, so avoid extra risk before locking in Grace payoffs.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Chirograph`][card-chirograph] – rebuilds your deck around [`Adjourn`][card-adjourn], [`Anoint`][card-anoint], and [`Channel Wrath`][card-channel-wrath], giving a turbo Reckoning start.
- [`Suturing Needle`][card-suturing-needle] – adds `Bag of Bones`/[`Ward Off`][card-ward-off] mix for safer early turns if you need more sustain.
- [`Finger Guillotine`][card-finger-guillotine] – +1 max HP per battle offsets blood payments and self damage.
- [`Red Beads`][card-red-beads] – turns your HP bleed into party healing; great in co-op where allies benefit from your sacrifices.
- [`Silver Spoon`][card-silver-spoon]/[`Clam`][card-clam] – standard gem economy; invest early so you can afford the 1-gem Bruja artifacts and Armory upgrades.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Track HP thresholds: many attacks gain bonus damage below 60–80% HP; plan blood costs to stay in the sweet spot without dying.
- Use [`Leeches`][card-leeches]/[`Sangria`][card-sangria] before big Reckoning detonation to stockpile `Healing Drops` for recovery.
- Fire [`Channel Wrath`][card-channel-wrath]/[`Veer Anger`][card-veer-anger] after stacking Reckoning; these cards strain, so reserve mana or HP for follow-up turns.
- [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off] and `Grace` let you survive counterattacks; stash Grace for [`Insolence`][card-insolence] draws only when you’re safe.
- Communicate in co-op: allies can finish low-HP enemies to prevent accidental overspends of blood cards.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Blood | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Leeches`][card-leeches] ×2 | 0 / 1 blood | Sustain | Deals chip damage, adds `Healing Drops` to hand. |
| `Cabrit sans Cor` | 1 / – | Reckoning + Grace | Kills add +4 Reckoning and Grace for draw/burst. |
| [`Adjourn`][card-adjourn] | 0 / 2 blood | Reckoning spike | Converts HP lost into +150% Reckoning and Grace; adds `Black Bile`. |
| [`Hex`][card-hex] | 1 / – | Stack builder | +3 Reckoning in small radius; bread-and-butter AOE. |
| [`Ill Intent`][card-ill-intent] | 1 / – | Single-target builder | +6 Reckoning + Grace on kill; solid on elites. |
| [`Channel Wrath`][card-channel-wrath] | 0 / – | Payoff | Deals damage equal to Reckoning; Strains, so plan mana. |
| [`Veer Anger`][card-veer-anger] | 0 / – | Payoff | Medium-radius Reckoning detonation; Strains. |
| [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off] | 1 / – | Block | Reliable block to cover blood turns. |
| [`Insolence`][card-insolence] | 0 / – | Grace cash-out | Spend Grace to draw 2, keeping engine running. |
| Flex slot | Varies | Utility | [`Anoint`][card-anoint] (blood draw), `Necrotize` (missing HP burst), or movement for positioning. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Channel Wrath`][card-channel-wrath]: at 25 Reckoning → 25 damage AOE ×2 when Strain repeats; aim for 30+ before Act II elites.
- [`Veer Anger`][card-veer-anger]: same scaling but wider cone; costly in HP if you mis-sequence due to Strain.
- [`Ill Intent`][card-ill-intent]/`Cabrit`: kills grant +6/+4 Reckoning; chain kills to climb quickly.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Share sustain responsibilities: teammates should feed block/artifacts so you can stay in the Reckoning sweet spot.
- Call out when you’re ready to detonate; allies can chip enemies down without stealing kills needed for Reckoning stacks.
- Boss phases: keep [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off] ready before Strain turns; use [`Adjourn`][card-adjourn] after a burst to restock Reckoning + Grace for the next cycle.

## Common Pitfalls
- Overspending blood when below 30 HP – always keep a `Healing Drops` or ally heal lined up.
- Casting [`Channel Wrath`][card-channel-wrath] with low Reckoning; wait until you have at least 15–20 stacks for value.
- Forgetting Strain on payoffs; back-to-back casts spiral mana/HP costs if you’re not prepared.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
