# Bruja Black Bile Cascade (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Medium (11/15) – the loop is powerful, but mismanaging HP and Bile draws can derail a 12-floor run.
- **Win condition**: stack Black Bile via `Adjourn`, `Libation`, and `Tongue Bite`, then detonate with `Bitter Incense`, `Humoric Attune`, and `Liturgy of Pain` for massive AOE.[1][2][3][4]
- **Best in**: mid/back slot where you can afford to manage HP while allies hold aggro.
- **Key stats**: every Black Bile increases Humoric Attune’s damage by +3; with 6 bile in deck, a single card hits for 20+ plus splash.

## Core Loop
1. Generate Black Bile using `Adjourn`, `Libation`, `Forewarn`, and `Tongue Bite` while controlling your HP with `Leeches`/`Healing Drops`.[1][2][5][6]
2. Draw into bile payoff cards (`Bitter Incense`, `Humoric Attune`, `Liturgy of Pain`) to deal huge splash damage and clear waves.[3][4]
3. Cleanse excess bile using `Linden Brew` or kill triggers to avoid hand clogging between bursts.[7]

## Draft Priorities
- **Bile generators**: `Adjourn`, `Libation`, `Forewarn`, `Tongue Bite`; take as many as your HP sustain allows.[1][2][5][6]
- **Payoffs**: `Bitter Incense`, `Humoric Attune`, `Liturgy of Pain`, `Autosarcophagy` for burst damage and draw.[3][4][8]
- **Control**: `Ward Off`, `Leeches`, `Sangria` to patch HP while you’re carrying bile cards.[6][9]
- **Cleansers**: `Linden Brew`, `Black Affinity` reduce bile penalties and add block per draw.[7][10]
- **Removals**: cut basic daggers early; focus deck around bile loops and sustain.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Bitter Incense`/`Humoric Attune` to raise damage and bile generation; follow with `Adjourn` to increase Reckoning/Grace alongside bile stacking.[3][1]
- **Hideout**: remove non-synergistic cards, Plan `Adjourn`, and funnel gems toward bile-friendly artifacts like `Linden Brew`.[11]
- **Vaults**: take when you need specific relics (HP regeneration) but avoid early if HP is unstable.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Linden Brew` – removes bile after kill and draws, keeping the deck lean.[7]
- `Black Affinity` – grants block when drawing bile, offsetting its drawback.[10]
- `Red Beads` – ding allies with heals when you self-damage via bile cards.[12]
- `Finger Guillotine` – max HP scaling offsets continuous HP payments.[13]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Generate bile early, but be ready to cash out before your hand clogs; `Tongue Bite` draws 3 and heals per bile drawn, great for recoveries.[6]
- Lead with `Bitter Incense` to add bile and splash damage, then follow with `Humoric Attune` for heavy hits.[3][4]
- Use `Forewarn`/`Ward Off` to cover yourself before drawing bile—block prevents chip kills while you set up bursts.[5][9]
- Keep at least one cleanse effect ready for boss phases so bile doesn’t strand essential cards in hand.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Blood | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Adjourn` ×2 | 0 / 2 blood | Bile + Reckoning | Core generator; watch HP cost.[1]
| `Libation` | 0 / 3 blood | Burst bile + Grace | Stack bile quickly; plan healing after.[2]
| `Tongue Bite` | 0 / 1 blood | Draw + heal | Mitigates bile penalties while refilling hand.[6]
| `Bitter Incense` | 0 / 2 blood | Splash damage | Adds bile and hits waves; upgrade early.[3]
| `Humoric Attune` | 0 / 2 blood | Finisher | Damage scales with bile count.[4]
| `Liturgy of Pain` | 0 / 4 blood | Mega burst | Clears entire sections when bile stacked.[8]
| `Leeches`/`Sangria` | 0 / 1–2 blood | Sustain | Provides Healing Drops to counter HP spend.[6]
| `Linden Brew` or `Black Affinity` | 1–2 / – | Cleanse/defense | Keeps bile manageable.[7][10]
| Flex slot | — | Utility | `Forewarn`, `Ward Off`, or `Autosarcophagy` depending on HP needs.[5][8]

## Damage Benchmarks
- 5 bile in deck → `Humoric Attune` hits for 17 damage; with `Liturgy of Pain`, expect 12×2 splash with additional repeats.[4][8]
- `Bitter Incense` deals 8 + 8 splash; combine with `Tongue Bite` to refill hand and heal.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Warn allies when bile explosions are coming; they can herd enemies into your splash zones.
- Keep `Linden Brew` active before long boss phases so bile doesn’t clog; use `Tongue Bite` to heal after thresholds.
- During co-op, rely on allies for block while you set up; your burst damage clears adds once bile is stacked.

## Common Pitfalls
- Overstacking bile without a payoff ready—always keep `Humoric Attune`/`Liturgy` on standby.
- Letting HP dip too low; schedule `Leeches`/`Sangria` after every blood-cost cycle.[6]
- Forgetting to cleanse; one `Linden Brew` cycle per floor prevents dead turns.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
