# Bruja Black Bile Cascade (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Medium (11/15) – the loop is powerful, but mismanaging HP and Bile draws can derail a 12-floor run.
- **Win condition**: stack Black Bile via [`Adjourn`][card-adjourn], [`Libation`][card-libation], and [`Tongue Bite`][card-tongue-bite], then detonate with [`Bitter Incense`][card-bitter-incense], [`Humoric Attune`][card-humoric-attune], and [`Liturgy of Pain`][card-liturgy-of-pain] for massive AOE.
- **Best in**: mid/back slot where you can afford to manage HP while allies hold aggro.
- **Key stats**: every Black Bile increases Humoric Attune’s damage by +3; with 6 bile in deck, a single card hits for 20+ plus splash.

## Core Loop
1. Generate Black Bile using [`Adjourn`][card-adjourn], [`Libation`][card-libation], [`Forewarn`][card-forewarn], and [`Tongue Bite`][card-tongue-bite] while controlling your HP with `Leeches`/`Healing Drops`.
2. Draw into bile payoff cards ([`Bitter Incense`][card-bitter-incense], [`Humoric Attune`][card-humoric-attune], [`Liturgy of Pain`][card-liturgy-of-pain]) to deal huge splash damage and clear waves.
3. Cleanse excess bile using [`Linden Brew`][card-linden-brew] or kill triggers to avoid hand clogging between bursts.

## Draft Priorities
- **Bile generators**: [`Adjourn`][card-adjourn], [`Libation`][card-libation], [`Forewarn`][card-forewarn], [`Tongue Bite`][card-tongue-bite]; take as many as your HP sustain allows.
- **Payoffs**: [`Bitter Incense`][card-bitter-incense], [`Humoric Attune`][card-humoric-attune], [`Liturgy of Pain`][card-liturgy-of-pain], `Autosarcophagy` for burst damage and draw.
- **Control**: [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off], `Leeches`, `Sangria` to patch HP while you’re carrying bile cards.
- **Cleansers**: [`Linden Brew`][card-linden-brew], [`Black Affinity`][card-black-affinity] reduce bile penalties and add block per draw.
- **Removals**: cut basic daggers early; focus deck around bile loops and sustain.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Bitter Incense`][card-bitter-incense]/[`Humoric Attune`][card-humoric-attune] to raise damage and bile generation; follow with [`Adjourn`][card-adjourn] to increase Reckoning/Grace alongside bile stacking.
- **Hideout**: remove non-synergistic cards, Plan [`Adjourn`][card-adjourn], and funnel gems toward bile-friendly artifacts like [`Linden Brew`][card-linden-brew].
- **Vaults**: take when you need specific relics (HP regeneration) but avoid early if HP is unstable.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Linden Brew`][card-linden-brew] – removes bile after kill and draws, keeping the deck lean.
- [`Black Affinity`][card-black-affinity] – grants block when drawing bile, offsetting its drawback.
- [`Red Beads`][card-red-beads] – ding allies with heals when you self-damage via bile cards.
- [`Finger Guillotine`][card-finger-guillotine] – max HP scaling offsets continuous HP payments.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Generate bile early, but be ready to cash out before your hand clogs; [`Tongue Bite`][card-tongue-bite] draws 3 and heals per bile drawn, great for recoveries.
- Lead with [`Bitter Incense`][card-bitter-incense] to add bile and splash damage, then follow with [`Humoric Attune`][card-humoric-attune] for heavy hits.
- Use [`Forewarn`][card-forewarn]/[`Ward Off`][card-ward-off] to cover yourself before drawing bile—block prevents chip kills while you set up bursts.
- Keep at least one cleanse effect ready for boss phases so bile doesn’t strand essential cards in hand.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Blood | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Adjourn`][card-adjourn] ×2 | 0 / 2 blood | Bile + Reckoning | Core generator; watch HP cost.
| [`Libation`][card-libation] | 0 / 3 blood | Burst bile + Grace | Stack bile quickly; plan healing after.
| [`Tongue Bite`][card-tongue-bite] | 0 / 1 blood | Draw + heal | Mitigates bile penalties while refilling hand.
| [`Bitter Incense`][card-bitter-incense] | 0 / 2 blood | Splash damage | Adds bile and hits waves; upgrade early.
| [`Humoric Attune`][card-humoric-attune] | 0 / 2 blood | Finisher | Damage scales with bile count.
| [`Liturgy of Pain`][card-liturgy-of-pain] | 0 / 4 blood | Mega burst | Clears entire sections when bile stacked.
| `Leeches`/`Sangria` | 0 / 1–2 blood | Sustain | Provides Healing Drops to counter HP spend.
| [`Linden Brew`][card-linden-brew] or [`Black Affinity`][card-black-affinity] | 1–2 / – | Cleanse/defense | Keeps bile manageable.
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Forewarn`][card-forewarn], [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off], or `Autosarcophagy` depending on HP needs.

## Damage Benchmarks
- 5 bile in deck → [`Humoric Attune`][card-humoric-attune] hits for 17 damage; with [`Liturgy of Pain`][card-liturgy-of-pain], expect 12×2 splash with additional repeats.
- [`Bitter Incense`][card-bitter-incense] deals 8 + 8 splash; combine with [`Tongue Bite`][card-tongue-bite] to refill hand and heal.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Warn allies when bile explosions are coming; they can herd enemies into your splash zones.
- Keep [`Linden Brew`][card-linden-brew] active before long boss phases so bile doesn’t clog; use [`Tongue Bite`][card-tongue-bite] to heal after thresholds.
- During co-op, rely on allies for block while you set up; your burst damage clears adds once bile is stacked.

## Common Pitfalls
- Overstacking bile without a payoff ready—always keep [`Humoric Attune`][card-humoric-attune]/`Liturgy` on standby.
- Letting HP dip too low; schedule `Leeches`/`Sangria` after every blood-cost cycle.
- Forgetting to cleanse; one [`Linden Brew`][card-linden-brew] cycle per floor prevents dead turns.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
