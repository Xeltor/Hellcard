# Bruja Storm Veil Tempest (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: stack hex debuffs ([`Withering Stare`][card-withering-stare], [`Nefarious Glance`][card-nefarious-glance], [`Ill Intent`][card-ill-intent]) to shred enemy damage and stack doom counters, then detonate with [`Soul Shatter`][card-soul-shatter]/[`Choir of Agony`][card-choir-of-agony].
- **Difficulty**: Medium (11/15) – requires good enemy knowledge and timing your detonations.
- **Best in**: co-op support; debuffs keep allies safe while you prepare finishing blows.
- **Key stats**: [`Withering Stare`][card-withering-stare] reduces damage taken by 3 per stack, and [`Soul Shatter`][card-soul-shatter] deals +4 damage per curse on the target.

## Core Loop
1. Apply curses every turn via [`Withering Stare`][card-withering-stare], [`Ill Intent`][card-ill-intent], [`Malfeasance`][card-malfeasance], and [`Nefarious Glance`][card-nefarious-glance].
2. Amplify curses with [`Humoric Attune`][card-humoric-attune] and [`Choir of Agony`][card-choir-of-agony], spreading debuffs to nearby enemies.
3. Cash them in with [`Soul Shatter`][card-soul-shatter] or [`Thousand Cuts`][card-thousand-cuts], then reapply curses on surviving foes.

## Draft Priorities
- **Curse core**: [`Withering Stare`][card-withering-stare], [`Ill Intent`][card-ill-intent], [`Nefarious Glance`][card-nefarious-glance], [`Malfeasance`][card-malfeasance]; upgrade Withering first.
- **Payoffs**: [`Soul Shatter`][card-soul-shatter], [`Thousand Cuts`][card-thousand-cuts], [`Choir of Agony`][card-choir-of-agony] convert stacks to damage.
- **Support**: [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off], [`Bone Knitting`][card-bone-knitting], [`Appease`][card-appease] ensure survival while curses build.
- **Removals**: drop bile cards; keep deck focused on curses.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: [`Withering Stare`][card-withering-stare] → [`Soul Shatter`][card-soul-shatter] → [`Choir of Agony`][card-choir-of-agony] for reliable scaling.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Withering Stare`][card-withering-stare], remove off-theme cards, and buy artifacts that add extra curses ([`Teeth Necklace`][card-teeth-necklace], [`Salt Circle`][card-salt-circle]).
- **Vaults**: optional but helpful; legendary curses like `Liturgy of Pain` supercharge the build.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Teeth Necklace`][card-teeth-necklace] – adds bleed when your curses land, accelerating kills.
- [`Salt Circle`][card-salt-circle] – gives +1 curse when casting rituals, making payoffs bigger.
- [`Inner Well`][card-inner-well] – mana battery for curse spam turns.
- [`Red Menace`][card-red-menace] – extra curse stacks on elites right out of the gate.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Stack [`Withering Stare`][card-withering-stare] on dangerous enemies first; every stack is -3 incoming damage.
- [`Ill Intent`][card-ill-intent] before [`Soul Shatter`][card-soul-shatter] ensures extra damage and stun.
- Spread curses with [`Choir of Agony`][card-choir-of-agony] when multiple enemies align; follow with [`Thousand Cuts`][card-thousand-cuts] to clean up.
- Co-op: call out targets you've heavily cursed so allies focus elsewhere.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Withering Stare`][card-withering-stare] ×2 | 1 / Common | Primary curse | Upgrade for -3 damage reduction. |
| [`Ill Intent`][card-ill-intent] ×2 | 1 / Common | Curse + stun | Locks down elites. |
| [`Nefarious Glance`][card-nefarious-glance] | 1 / Rare | Curse spread | Keeps stacks rolling. |
| [`Malfeasance`][card-malfeasance] | 1 / Rare | Curse + damage | Helps chip while debuffing. |
| [`Humoric Attune`][card-humoric-attune] | 0 / Rare | Amplify | Doubles curses for next payoff. |
| [`Choir of Agony`][card-choir-of-agony] | 2 / Rare | AOE payoff | Spreads curses and deals damage. |
| [`Soul Shatter`][card-soul-shatter] | 1 / Rare | Single-target payoff | Hits huge numbers on cursed foes. |
| [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off] | 0 / Common | Defense | Free block after curse turns. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Bone Knitting`][card-bone-knitting], [`Appease`][card-appease], or artifact brews as needed. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- 3 curses + [`Soul Shatter`][card-soul-shatter] yields 16 damage while stripping armor.
- [`Humoric Attune`][card-humoric-attune] into [`Choir of Agony`][card-choir-of-agony] deals 20+ split damage Act II onward.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Debuff bosses to keep party safe; [`Withering Stare`][card-withering-stare] stacks blunt massive hits.
- Save [`Soul Shatter`][card-soul-shatter] for boss vulnerable windows; it scales with every curse applied.
- Share [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off] to cover allies diving into melee.

## Common Pitfalls
- Splitting curses between targets—focus one high-threat enemy at a time.
- Forgetting to recast curses after payoffs; stacks fall off quickly otherwise.
- Running out of mana; grab [`Inner Well`][card-inner-well] or [`Appease`][card-appease] for sustain.
