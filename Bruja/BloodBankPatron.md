# Bruja Blood Bank Patron (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: convert self-inflicted HP loss into team healing and cards via `Leeches`, `Sangria`, and `Healing Blood` loops, while allies provide the finishing blows.[1][2][3]
- **Difficulty**: Low (6/15) – gentle resource management keeps the 12-floor campaign safe, as long as you rotate heals consistently.
- **Best in**: backline co-op support; ideal for stabilizing allies who burn HP or mana aggressively.
- **Key stats**: every `Sangria` adds two `Healing Drops`; with `Mercy Plea` active you gain Grace when patching allies, feeding `Insolence` draw turns.[2][4]

## Core Loop
1. Generate `Healing Drops` using `Leeches`, `Sangria`, and artifacts like `Horse's Head`.[1][2][5]
2. Distribute healing/block (`Cover` if splashed, `Ward Off`) so allies stay topped off while you build Grace via `Mercy Plea`.
3. Spend Grace on `Insolence`/`Haruspicy` to draw cards, then repeat the cycle while allies execute enemies.[3][6]

## Draft Priorities
- **Healing tools**: `Leeches`, `Sangria`, `Forewarn`, `Healing Blood`—keep the drop engine running.[1][2][7]
- **Grace synergy**: `Mercy Plea`, `Insolence`, `Haruspicy` reward you for paying HP and healing others.[4][3][6]
- **Block support**: `Ward Off`, `Cover`, `Protect` if offered to shield allies between heals.[8][9]
- **Utility**: `Tongue Bite` for burst draw + healing, `Libation` when you need Reckoning to power Haruspicy.[10][2]
- **Removals**: drop high-risk bile attacks; this build aims to stay healthy.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Leeches`/`Sangria` to increase Healing Drop output; follow with `Ward Off` for safer elite turns.[1][2][8]
- **Hideout**: remove damage-only cards, Plan `Leeches`, and invest gems until you find sustain artifacts like `Red Beads` or `Golden Onion`.[11]
- **Vaults**: optional—take them when you want unique support relics.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Red Beads` – allies heal when you self-damage, making every blood payment profitable.[12]
- `Mercy Plea` – the keystone that grants Grace on HP loss, fuelling your draw engine.[4]
- `Golden Onion` – passive regen so you can keep donating HP without risk.[13]
- `Finger Guillotine` – +1 max HP after each battle to stay ahead of self-damage.[14]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Cast `Leeches` early each fight to stock Healing Drops, then stash them for allies after big hits.[1]
- Play `Insolence` only when you have Grace; plan blood payments first (`Sangria`, `Mercy Plea` triggers).[2][3]
- Keep at least one drop for yourself; hovering around 60–80% HP maintains safety across floors.
- Share healing priorities with allies so they know when to expect drops versus when you’re drawing for Grace.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Blood | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Leeches` ×2 | 0 / 1 blood | Sustain | Generates drops and chip damage.[1] |
| `Sangria` | 0 / 2 blood | Ally heal | Adds Healing Drops, pairs with Mercy Plea.[2] |
| `Mercy Plea` | 2 / Legendary | Grace engine | Gains Grace whenever you pay HP.[4] |
| `Insolence` | 0 / Common | Draw | Spend Grace for cards; upgrade early.[3] |
| `Haruspicy` | 1 / Rare | Mana + draw | Converts Grace/Reckoning into resources.[6] |
| `Ward Off` | 1 / Common | Block | Keeps you and allies safe while healing.[8] |
| `Tongue Bite` | 0 / Rare | Burst heal | Draws and heals when bile is present.[10] |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | `Forewarn`, `Libation`, or ally-support cards as needed.[7][2] |

## Damage Benchmarks
- This build isn’t about damage; focus on keeping allies alive so their builds scale. Expect to deal chip damage through `Leeches` while feeding Grace draws.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Coordinate healing windows—let allies know when drops are incoming so they plan aggressive plays.
- Keep `Ward Off` ready for boss thresholds; you’re the safety net while others burst.
- Use `Haruspicy` post-heal to restock mana for allies before entering the next floor.

## Common Pitfalls
- Overhealing when drops are scarce; always keep one in reserve.
- Letting Grace sit unused—turn it into cards each floor, or you’ll fall behind on support options.
- Forgetting to remove risky attack cards; a clean deck ensures you always draw heals/utility.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
