# Bruja Blood Bank Patron (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: convert self-inflicted HP loss into team healing and cards via [`Leeches`][card-leeches], [`Sangria`][card-sangria], and `Healing Blood` loops, while allies provide the finishing blows.
- **Difficulty**: Low (6/15) – gentle resource management keeps the 12-floor campaign safe, as long as you rotate heals consistently.
- **Best in**: backline co-op support; ideal for stabilizing allies who burn HP or mana aggressively.
- **Key stats**: every [`Sangria`][card-sangria] adds two `Healing Drops`; with [`Mercy Plea`][card-mercy-plea] active you gain Grace when patching allies, feeding [`Insolence`][card-insolence] draw turns.

## Core Loop
1. Generate `Healing Drops` using [`Leeches`][card-leeches], [`Sangria`][card-sangria], and artifacts like [`Horse's Head`][card-horses-head].
2. Distribute healing/block ([`Cover`][card-cover] if splashed, [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off]) so allies stay topped off while you build Grace via [`Mercy Plea`][card-mercy-plea].
3. Spend Grace on [`Insolence`][card-insolence]/[`Haruspicy`][card-haruspicy] to draw cards, then repeat the cycle while allies execute enemies.

## Draft Priorities
- **Healing tools**: [`Leeches`][card-leeches], [`Sangria`][card-sangria], [`Forewarn`][card-forewarn], `Healing Blood`—keep the drop engine running.
- **Grace synergy**: [`Mercy Plea`][card-mercy-plea], [`Insolence`][card-insolence], [`Haruspicy`][card-haruspicy] reward you for paying HP and healing others.
- **Block support**: [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off], [`Cover`][card-cover], `Protect` if offered to shield allies between heals.
- **Utility**: [`Tongue Bite`][card-tongue-bite] for burst draw + healing, `Libation` when you need Reckoning to power Haruspicy.
- **Removals**: drop high-risk bile attacks; this build aims to stay healthy.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Leeches`][card-leeches]/[`Sangria`][card-sangria] to increase Healing Drop output; follow with [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off] for safer elite turns.
- **Hideout**: remove damage-only cards, Plan [`Leeches`][card-leeches], and invest gems until you find sustain artifacts like [`Red Beads`][card-red-beads] or [`Golden Onion`][card-golden-onion].
- **Vaults**: optional—take them when you want unique support relics.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Red Beads`][card-red-beads] – allies heal when you self-damage, making every blood payment profitable.
- [`Mercy Plea`][card-mercy-plea] – the keystone that grants Grace on HP loss, fuelling your draw engine.
- [`Golden Onion`][card-golden-onion] – passive regen so you can keep donating HP without risk.
- [`Finger Guillotine`][card-finger-guillotine] – +1 max HP after each battle to stay ahead of self-damage.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Cast [`Leeches`][card-leeches] early each fight to stock Healing Drops, then stash them for allies after big hits.
- Play [`Insolence`][card-insolence] only when you have Grace; plan blood payments first ([`Sangria`][card-sangria], [`Mercy Plea`][card-mercy-plea] triggers).
- Keep at least one drop for yourself; hovering around 60–80% HP maintains safety across floors.
- Share healing priorities with allies so they know when to expect drops versus when you’re drawing for Grace.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Blood | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Leeches`][card-leeches] ×2 | 0 / 1 blood | Sustain | Generates drops and chip damage. |
| [`Sangria`][card-sangria] | 0 / 2 blood | Ally heal | Adds Healing Drops, pairs with Mercy Plea. |
| [`Mercy Plea`][card-mercy-plea] | 2 / Legendary | Grace engine | Gains Grace whenever you pay HP. |
| [`Insolence`][card-insolence] | 0 / Common | Draw | Spend Grace for cards; upgrade early. |
| [`Haruspicy`][card-haruspicy] | 1 / Rare | Mana + draw | Converts Grace/Reckoning into resources. |
| [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off] | 1 / Common | Block | Keeps you and allies safe while healing. |
| [`Tongue Bite`][card-tongue-bite] | 0 / Rare | Burst heal | Draws and heals when bile is present. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Forewarn`][card-forewarn], `Libation`, or ally-support cards as needed. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- This build isn’t about damage; focus on keeping allies alive so their builds scale. Expect to deal chip damage through [`Leeches`][card-leeches] while feeding Grace draws.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Coordinate healing windows—let allies know when drops are incoming so they plan aggressive plays.
- Keep [`Ward Off`][card-ward-off] ready for boss thresholds; you’re the safety net while others burst.
- Use [`Haruspicy`][card-haruspicy] post-heal to restock mana for allies before entering the next floor.

## Common Pitfalls
- Overhealing when drops are scarce; always keep one in reserve.
- Letting Grace sit unused—turn it into cards each floor, or you’ll fall behind on support options.
- Forgetting to remove risky attack cards; a clean deck ensures you always draw heals/utility.

## Changelog
