# Bruja Twin Vitae Ritualist (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: juggle HP totals using [`Transfuse`][card-transfuse], [`Drain Essence`][card-drain-essence], and [`Work Life Balance`][card-work-life-balance], keeping yourself and allies alive while dealing damage through [`Soul Shield`][card-soul-shield]/[`Lifesteal`][card-lifesteal] procs.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (9/15) – demands awareness of ally HP, but card pool is forgiving.
- **Best in**: co-op support; excels at stabilizing parties on long runs.
- **Key stats**: [`Transfuse`][card-transfuse] transfers 6 HP between targets, and [`Work Life Balance`][card-work-life-balance] converts drained HP into Wrath and healing simultaneously.

## Core Loop
1. Use [`Transfuse`][card-transfuse]/[`Drain Essence`][card-drain-essence] to balance ally HP while chipping enemies.
2. Cast [`Work Life Balance`][card-work-life-balance], [`Appeal to Mercy`][card-appeal-to-mercy], and [`Libation`][card-libation] to recycle health and build moderate Wrath.
3. Spend accumulated resources with [`Soul Shield`][card-soul-shield], [`Lifesteal`][card-lifesteal], and [`Violent Cycle`][card-violent-cycle] when damage opportunities appear.

## Draft Priorities
- **HP transfer**: [`Transfuse`][card-transfuse], [`Drain Essence`][card-drain-essence], [`Appeal to Mercy`][card-appeal-to-mercy]; upgrade Transfuse first.
- **Sustain tools**: [`Work Life Balance`][card-work-life-balance], [`Libation`][card-libation], [`Bone Knitting`][card-bone-knitting] keep the team healthy.
- **Payoffs**: [`Soul Shield`][card-soul-shield], [`Lifesteal`][card-lifesteal], [`Violent Cycle`][card-violent-cycle] convert HP swings into damage.
- **Removals**: drop bile/burn cards that don’t contribute to the life engine.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: [`Transfuse`][card-transfuse] → [`Work Life Balance`][card-work-life-balance] → [`Soul Shield`][card-soul-shield] for stronger transfers and shields.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Transfuse`][card-transfuse], remove off-theme cards, invest in artifacts that add healing brews ([`Linden Brew`][card-linden-brew], [`Ribleaf Compress`][card-ribleaf-compress]).
- **Vaults**: worthwhile—legendary heals like `Mercy Plea` double as panic buttons.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Linden Brew`][card-linden-brew] – free heal each combat stacks with transfer effects.
- [`Ribleaf Compress`][card-ribleaf-compress] – gives block so HP swaps don’t leave you exposed.
- [`Inner Well`][card-inner-well] – mana battery for casting multiple heals in one turn.
- [`Teeth Necklace`][card-teeth-necklace] – bonus damage whenever you drain enemies.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Stabilize ally HP before chasing damage; a wiped teammate means no targets for transfers.
- [`Work Life Balance`][card-work-life-balance] after [`Drain Essence`][card-drain-essence] converts stolen HP into Wrath and healing.
- Save [`Soul Shield`][card-soul-shield] for turns with multiple drains—it scales with total HP exchanged.
- Co-op: communicate who needs healing; [`Transfuse`][card-transfuse] can save allies at 1 HP instantly.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Transfuse`][card-transfuse] ×2 | 1 / Common | HP swap | Upgrade for bigger transfers. |
| [`Drain Essence`][card-drain-essence] ×2 | 1 / Common | Damage + heal | Primary lifesteal. |
| [`Work Life Balance`][card-work-life-balance] | 0 / Rare | Sustain | Converts drain into healing + Wrath. |
| [`Appeal to Mercy`][card-appeal-to-mercy] | 0 / Rare | Ally heal | Free top-offs on low allies. |
| [`Libation`][card-libation] | 0 / Common | Heal + draw | Keep hand size healthy. |
| [`Bone Knitting`][card-bone-knitting] | 0 / Common | Sustain | Extra healing each turn. |
| [`Soul Shield`][card-soul-shield] | 1 / Rare | Payoff | Block equal to damage dealt with drains. |
| [`Lifesteal`][card-lifesteal] | 0 / Rare | Finisher | Extra damage/heal when drains stack. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Violent Cycle`][card-violent-cycle], [`Inner Well`][card-inner-well], or artifact brews as needed. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- Double [`Drain Essence`][card-drain-essence] + [`Work Life Balance`][card-work-life-balance] swings 12 HP while granting 6 Wrath.
- [`Soul Shield`][card-soul-shield] post-transfer adds 12 block and damage at Wrath 4.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Keep track of ally HP thresholds; [`Transfuse`][card-transfuse] can reset lethal DoTs on bosses.
- Combine [`Appeal to Mercy`][card-appeal-to-mercy] with [`Work Life Balance`][card-work-life-balance] to heal allies without losing Wrath stacks.
- Boss enrages love to target you—maintain [`Soul Shield`][card-soul-shield] uptime to avoid spikes.

## Common Pitfalls
- Overdraining yourself; make sure heals are lined up before big transfers.
- Forgetting to remove excess bile cards, leading to inconsistent draws.
- Casting [`Work Life Balance`][card-work-life-balance] without any drains wastes the Wrath conversion.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
