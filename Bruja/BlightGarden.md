# Bruja Blight Garden Cultivator (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: stack bile counters with [`Black Bile`][card-black-bile], [`Boils`][card-boils], and [`Bile Blade`][card-bile-blade], then spread infection using [`Worm Stew`][card-worm-stew] and [`Mandragore Tea`][card-mandragore-tea] while sustaining through brews.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (10/15) – sequencing infections and managing HP matters, but most cards are accessible rares.
- **Best in**: backline co-op; thrives when allies stall while poison ticks.
- **Key stats**: upgraded [`Black Bile`][card-black-bile] applies 5 bile in a wide cone, and [`Worm Stew`][card-worm-stew] doubles bile stacks on the primary target.

## Core Loop
1. Apply bile with [`Black Bile`][card-black-bile], [`Boils`][card-boils], and [`Bile Blade`][card-bile-blade] every turn.
2. Spread and double stacks using [`Worm Stew`][card-worm-stew], [`Mandragore Tea`][card-mandragore-tea], and [`Crimson Tide`][card-crimson-tide].
3. Use [`Bone Knitting`][card-bone-knitting]/[`Lifesteal`][card-lifesteal] brews to stay healthy while bile finishes enemies.

## Draft Priorities
- **Bile sources**: [`Black Bile`][card-black-bile], [`Boils`][card-boils], [`Bile Blade`][card-bile-blade]; upgrade Black Bile first.
- **Spread tools**: [`Worm Stew`][card-worm-stew], [`Mandragore Tea`][card-mandragore-tea], [`Crimson Tide`][card-crimson-tide], [`Paint Pentacle`][card-paint-pentacle] for mark conversions.
- **Sustain**: [`Bone Knitting`][card-bone-knitting], [`Lifesteal`][card-lifesteal], [`Appeal to Mercy`][card-appeal-to-mercy] keep HP topped.
- **Removals**: cut non-bile attacks; you want every draw advancing infection.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: [`Black Bile`][card-black-bile] → [`Worm Stew`][card-worm-stew] → [`Mandragore Tea`][card-mandragore-tea] ensures reliable scaling.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Black Bile`][card-black-bile], remove stray damage cards, and buy artifacts that add brews ([`Linden Brew`][card-linden-brew], [`Ribleaf Compress`][card-ribleaf-compress]).
- **Vaults**: take once bile core online; legendary brews accelerate sustain.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Linden Brew`][card-linden-brew] – free heal/bile brew each combat keeps you in the fight.
- [`Ribleaf Compress`][card-ribleaf-compress] – extra block while you wait for bile ticks.
- [`Salt Circle`][card-salt-circle] – +1 bile when you cast rituals; perfect for spread turns.
- [`Teeth Necklace`][card-teeth-necklace] – adds bleed on bile hits, stacking more dots.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Apply bile first, then double with [`Worm Stew`][card-worm-stew]; doubling zero wastes the card.
- Cast [`Mandragore Tea`][card-mandragore-tea] before [`Crimson Tide`][card-crimson-tide] so new enemies enter infected.
- Keep [`Bone Knitting`][card-bone-knitting] handy for elite turns; bile decks often take chip hits while waiting.
- Co-op: signal allies when your target will explode so they swap focus early.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Black Bile`][card-black-bile] ×2 | 1 / Rare | Primary bile | Upgrade for larger cone + stacks. |
| [`Boils`][card-boils] | 1 / Common | Supplemental bile | Cheap single-target stacker. |
| [`Bile Blade`][card-bile-blade] | 1 / Rare | Melee bile | Great when enemies close in. |
| [`Worm Stew`][card-worm-stew] | 1 / Rare | Spread/double | Core payoff. |
| [`Mandragore Tea`][card-mandragore-tea] | 1 / Rare | Spread | Adds bile + heal each round. |
| [`Crimson Tide`][card-crimson-tide] | 1 / Rare | Lane spread | Pulls bile through whole ranks. |
| [`Bone Knitting`][card-bone-knitting] | 0 / Common | Sustain | Free heal on infected enemies. |
| [`Lifesteal`][card-lifesteal] | 0 / Rare | Sustain | Converts excess bile into healing. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Paint Pentacle`][card-paint-pentacle], [`Appeal to Mercy`][card-appeal-to-mercy], or artifact brews as needed. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Black Bile`][card-black-bile] + [`Worm Stew`][card-worm-stew] hits 18+ bile on Act II elites within two turns.
- [`Crimson Tide`][card-crimson-tide] spreads 10+ bile through entire lanes when stacks are primed.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Bile ignores block; ideal for armored bosses while allies protect you.
- Share brews from artifacts if allies need healing—bile decks often over-heal.
- Keep [`Bone Knitting`][card-bone-knitting] ready for boss slams; healing per infected target skyrockets.

## Common Pitfalls
- Doubling bile too early—wait until stacks reach at least 6 on key targets.
- Neglecting defense; add [`Ribleaf Compress`][card-ribleaf-compress] to survive while dots tick.
- Overfilling deck with brews; keep ratio of bile generators high.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
