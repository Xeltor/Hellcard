# Rogue Gems – Gem Banker (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: stack gemstones, then convert them into 2×-scaling damage via `Shakedown`, `Trickle Down`, and `Stonks` while chaining mana-refund stuns.[1][2][3][4][5]
- **Difficulty**: High (12/15) – sequencing and rare pickups make the 12-floor clear demanding, but stabilises once you hold 6+ gems.
- **Best in**: solo or co-op when the team can funnel gems and protect the Rogue’s lane.
- **Key stats**: every 4 gems unlocks guaranteed AOE stuns + +1 mana from `Bling`/`Payback`; 10+ gems lets a single `Trickle Down` wipe most Act II boards.

## Core Loop
1. Spend early turns banking gems through events and conservative play. After spending 3 gems on an Armory upgrade, prioritise the next combat node (or co-op gem gifts) so you climb back to the 4-gem stun threshold before an elite.[4][5][10]
2. Use cheap draw (`Adapt`, `Luck`) and cost reducers (`Eagle Trick`, `Overexertion`) to set up multiple payoff casts in one turn while planning for the `Tired` penalty Overexertion applies.[6][7][8][9][19]
3. Fire `Trickle Down`/`Stonks` first to clear waves, then `Shakedown` to finish survivors.[1][2][3]
4. Keep ≥4 gems to fuel `Bling`/`Payback` stuns that refund mana and lock enemies.[4][5]

## Draft Priorities
- **Must-grab payoffs**: `Shakedown` (duplicate when possible), `Trickle Down`, `Stonks` for legendary ceiling.[1][2][3]
- **Engine pieces**: `Adapt`, `Luck`, `Eagle Trick`, `Overexertion` – all support low-mana chains and protect against exhaust RNG.[6][7][8][9]
- **Defensive glue**: at least one `Bling` and one `Payback` to hold elites/bosses while you bank gems.[4][5]
- **Removals**: cut non-scaling starters (`Throw Daggers`, `Hook Kick`) at the first Hideout to keep the deck 8–11 cards.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory first**: prioritize upgrading `Shakedown` (damage) then `Trickle Down` (bigger AOE) – upgrades outscale early artifacts.[1][2]
- **Hideout**: remove filler, use **Plan** to pin either `Trickle Down` or `Bling` so your opener is live, and gift spare gems from allies to the Rogue.[10]
  In solo runs, route through at least one extra fight after an Armory spend so natural gem drops push you back above the stun threshold before elites.[4][5][10]
- **Vaults**: visit only if you already upgraded the payoffs; the loss of raw gems delays your kill thresholds.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Silver Spoon` – immediate +3 gems accelerates the first Armory upgrade.[11]
- `Whale Figurine` – +1 gem after each fight keeps scaling without diverting map pathing.[12]
- `Clam` – +1 gem per card reward (cannot skip); viable if you have removal budget to clear the junk later.[13]
- `Sticky Finger` – draws whenever the hand empties, offsetting `Trickle Down`/`Stonks` exhaust.[14]
- `Key` – Rogue 1-gem starter that grants +1 mana on your opener, smoothing the post-upgrade turn where you briefly dip below 4 gems.[16]
- `Brass Cog` – another 1-gem Rogue artifact that upgrades a `Sharp Arrow` into `Rogue Tactics`, adding a reusable setup piece once you finish removals.[17]
- `Grabber` – 2-gem Rogue artifact that feeds a random Bomb each turn; pair it with stun turns so Ignite draws convert into free clears.[18]
- Defensive reshapers (`Chocolate Box`, `Veteran Pin`) belong on allies unless your own deck still needs a full rebuild.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Play all zero-cost set-up cards before any payoff to dodge random exhaust hits.[2][3]
- If hand is crowded, lead with `Overexertion` → `Eagle Trick` to set multiple payoffs to 0 and keep mana for stuns.[8][9]
- Always hold a stun for the last action; `Bling`/`Payback` refund mana at ≥4 gems, giving another payoff or draw cast.[4][5]
- Position: occupy mid or back tiles so allies can funnel stunned targets into your radius.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Shakedown` ×2 | 1 / Common | Single-target finisher | Upgrade ASAP for +damage per gem.[1] |
| `Trickle Down` | 2 / Rare | Primary AOE | Exhaust risk—plan hand order carefully.[2] |
| `Stonks` | 2 / Legendary | Legendary sweep | Use when board is clustered; expect random exhaust.[3] |
| `Adapt` | 0 / Rare | Card draw | Chain through zero-costs when hand is thin.[6] |
| `Luck` | 0 / Common | Card draw | Digs for 0-costs to keep engine rolling.[7] |
| `Eagle Trick` | 1 / Common | Cost reducer | Sets random payoff to 0; play before shuffles.[8] |
| `Overexertion` | 1 / Rare | Burst setup | Makes two cards free; accept next-turn `Tired`.[9][19] |
| `Bling` | 1 / Rare | AOE stun | Locks waves and refunds mana at 4+ gems.[4] |
| `Payback` | 1 / Common | Single stun | Covers bosses that survive AOE.[5] |
| Flex slot | Varies | Utility | Third `Luck`, second `Bling`, or `Rallying Cry` for extra zero-cost setup and crowd control.[4][7][15] |

## Gem Damage Breakpoints (per payoff)
| Gems held | `Shakedown` damage | `Trickle Down`/`Stonks` total |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 8 | 8 AOE |
| 6 | 12 | 12 AOE |
| 8 | 16 | 16 AOE |
| 10 | 20 | 20 AOE |
| 12 | 24 | 24 AOE |
| 15 | 30 | 30 AOE |

Use this table when deciding whether to spend gems; holding even thresholds before elites maximises wipe odds while keeping `Bling`/`Payback` refunds online.[1][2][3][4][5]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- **Co-op funnel**: teammates should gift gems at Hideouts until the Rogue reaches 8–10; the first wipe turn usually lands on Floor 2 elite or Act II opener.[10]
- **Boss plan**: save `Stonks` for minion phases; against single targets, stack up to 12+ gems then double `Shakedown` for 24× damage output.

## Common Pitfalls
- Over-spending gems at Vaults or on rerolls – slows damage spikes and the mana refund threshold.
- Casting `Trickle Down` with critical cards still in hand – the exhaust can delete your only stun or payoff.[2]
- Forgetting the `Tired` penalty from `Overexertion`; plan to end turns with a stun or move so the lost mana next turn does not brick you.[9]

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Rewritten with updated sourcing and sequencing guidance (Codex).
