# Rogue Shadowstep Assassin (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: use movement tricks (`Kick`, `Akanbe`, `Shadowstep` artifacts) to isolate targets, then burst them with high-damage daggers (`Seeping Wound`, `Necrotize`) and stun chains.[1][2][3][4]
- **Difficulty**: High (13/15) – mastering range control and HP thresholds is essential to beat all 12 floors without getting overwhelmed.
- **Best in**: solo or co-op mid slot; excels at deleting priority elites while allies cover lanes.
- **Key stats**: `Seeping Wound` hits for 9 when below 60% HP; combine it with `Payback` and `Loaded Die` for safe, guaranteed kills.

## Core Loop
1. Shift enemies with `Kick`/`Akanbe` to isolate them in your lane or away from allies.[1][2]
2. Drop stun cards (`Payback`, `*Bonk*`) to lock a target, then finish with HP-scaling daggers (`Necrotize`, `Seeping Wound`).[3][4][5]
3. Use sustain tools (`Leeches`, `Cover`) to offset chip damage while you intentionally dip below HP thresholds for bonus damage.[6][7]

## Draft Priorities
- **Movement**: `Akanbe`, `Kick`, `Loaded Die` (marks random targets to focus) keep enemies where you want them.[1][2][8]
- **Burst daggers**: `Seeping Wound`, `Necrotize`, `Tit for Tat`, `Double Cut` ensure kills once targets are alone.[4][5][9][10]
- **Control**: `Payback`, `*Bonk*`, `Osoto Gari` chain stuns and break block.[3][11][12]
- **Sustain**: `Leeches`, `Sangria`, `Cover` maintain survivability while playing around low HP bonuses.[6][7]
- **Removals**: trim arrows and bombs—this build wants the leanest possible dagger package.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Seeping Wound`/`Necrotize` first for bigger missing-HP multipliers; follow with `Payback` for lower stun cooldowns.[4][5][3]
- **Hideout**: remove redundant arrows, Plan `Seeping Wound`, and invest gems until you afford artifacts like `Horse's Head` or `Golden Onion`.[13]
- **Vaults**: only when your HP buffers are stable; otherwise focus on upgrades and Hideout removals.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Horse's Head` – adds `Death Mark` and `Osoto Gari`, giving burst targets and block breaks.[12]
- `Golden Onion` – heals chip damage so you can hover in the 50–70% HP sweet spot safely.[14]
- `Salt` – mana refunds after long combo turns keep stuns available.[15]
- `Silver Spoon` – early gem boost to accelerate upgrades and artifact purchases.[16]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Start with mark or repositioning (`Loaded Die`, `Akanbe`), then stun the isolated target before unleashing daggers.[2][8][3]
- Plan HP thresholds: use `Leeches` to recover right after a dagger kills to avoid accidental deaths.[6]
- `Necrotize` and `Tit for Tat` scale with missing HP; don’t overheal before a big burst unless bosses are about to swing.[5][10]
- Coordinate with allies so they delay AOEs until after you reposition enemies—your daggers need isolated targets.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Akanbe` | 1 / Common | Pulls enemies | Keeps elites near for stun bursts.[1] |
| `Kick` | 0 / Common | Push control | Shoves dangerous foes to far lanes.[2] |
| `Seeping Wound` | 1 / Rare | HP-scaling strike | Upgrade early; lethal below 60% HP.[4] |
| `Necrotize` | 1 / Common | Missing-HP burst | Strain makes it ideal for finishing bosses.[5] |
| `Payback` | 1 / Common | Stun + refund | Locks targets for dagger turns.[3] |
| `*Bonk*` | 1 / Common | Backup stun | Covers turns when you lack gems for `Payback`.[11] |
| `Leeches` | 0 / Starter | Sustain | Produces `Healing Drops` to manage HP.[6] |
| `Cover` | 1 / Common | Block | Protects while playing around low HP thresholds.[7] |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | `Tit for Tat`, `Double Cut`, or artifact-added bombs for extra burst.[9][10] |

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Seeping Wound` + `Necrotize` from 50% HP wipes 20 HP elites instantly.
- `Payback` refunds mana at 4+ gems, enabling double-stun turns even late in Act III.[3]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Communicate reposition plays so allies don’t waste movement; you can yank bosses/packs into safe lanes.
- Keep one stun for boss thresholds—being able to `Payback` the boss mid-phase keeps your HP manipulation safe.
- Allies with freeze/stun add-ons (Mage, Tinkerer) help trigger dagger bonuses; coordinate to chain crowd control.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to heal after HP-cost attacks—always follow `Leeches`/`Sangria` after big bursts.[6]
- Playing `Kick` last; you may accidentally move the target out of dagger range.
- Keeping too many non-dagger cards; this build needs tight draw density to function reliably.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
