# Rogue Shadowstep Assassin (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: use movement tricks ([`Kick`][card-kick], [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe], `Shadowstep` artifacts) to isolate targets, then burst them with high-damage daggers ([`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound], [`Necrotize`][card-necrotize]) and stun chains.
- **Difficulty**: High (13/15) – mastering range control and HP thresholds is essential to beat all 12 floors without getting overwhelmed.
- **Best in**: solo or co-op mid slot; excels at deleting priority elites while allies cover lanes.
- **Key stats**: [`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound] hits for 9 when below 60% HP; combine it with [`Payback`][card-payback] and [`Loaded Die`][card-loaded-die] for safe, guaranteed kills.

## Core Loop
1. Shift enemies with [`Kick`][card-kick]/[`Akanbe`][card-akanbe] to isolate them in your lane or away from allies.
2. Drop stun cards ([`Payback`][card-payback], [`*Bonk*`][card-bonk]) to lock a target, then finish with HP-scaling daggers ([`Necrotize`][card-necrotize], [`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound]).
3. Use sustain tools ([`Leeches`][card-leeches], [`Cover`][card-cover]) to offset chip damage while you intentionally dip below HP thresholds for bonus damage.

## Draft Priorities
- **Movement**: [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe], [`Kick`][card-kick], [`Loaded Die`][card-loaded-die] (marks random targets to focus) keep enemies where you want them.
- **Burst daggers**: [`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound], [`Necrotize`][card-necrotize], [`Tit for Tat`][card-tit-for-tat], [`Double Cut`][card-double-cut] ensure kills once targets are alone.
- **Control**: [`Payback`][card-payback], [`*Bonk*`][card-bonk], [`Osoto Gari`][card-osoto-gari] chain stuns and break block.
- **Sustain**: [`Leeches`][card-leeches], `Sangria`, [`Cover`][card-cover] maintain survivability while playing around low HP bonuses.
- **Removals**: trim arrows and bombs—this build wants the leanest possible dagger package.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound]/[`Necrotize`][card-necrotize] first for bigger missing-HP multipliers; follow with [`Payback`][card-payback] for lower stun cooldowns.
- **Hideout**: remove redundant arrows, Plan [`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound], and invest gems until you afford artifacts like `Horse's Head` or [`Golden Onion`][card-golden-onion].
- **Vaults**: only when your HP buffers are stable; otherwise focus on upgrades and Hideout removals.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Horse's Head` – adds `Death Mark` and [`Osoto Gari`][card-osoto-gari], giving burst targets and block breaks.
- [`Golden Onion`][card-golden-onion] – heals chip damage so you can hover in the 50–70% HP sweet spot safely.
- [`Salt`][card-salt] – mana refunds after long combo turns keep stuns available.
- [`Silver Spoon`][card-silver-spoon] – early gem boost to accelerate upgrades and artifact purchases.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Start with mark or repositioning ([`Loaded Die`][card-loaded-die], [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe]), then stun the isolated target before unleashing daggers.
- Plan HP thresholds: use [`Leeches`][card-leeches] to recover right after a dagger kills to avoid accidental deaths.
- [`Necrotize`][card-necrotize] and [`Tit for Tat`][card-tit-for-tat] scale with missing HP; don’t overheal before a big burst unless bosses are about to swing.
- Coordinate with allies so they delay AOEs until after you reposition enemies—your daggers need isolated targets.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe] | 1 / Common | Pulls enemies | Keeps elites near for stun bursts. |
| [`Kick`][card-kick] | 0 / Common | Push control | Shoves dangerous foes to far lanes. |
| [`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound] | 1 / Rare | HP-scaling strike | Upgrade early; lethal below 60% HP. |
| [`Necrotize`][card-necrotize] | 1 / Common | Missing-HP burst | Strain makes it ideal for finishing bosses. |
| [`Payback`][card-payback] | 1 / Common | Stun + refund | Locks targets for dagger turns. |
| [`*Bonk*`][card-bonk] | 1 / Common | Backup stun | Covers turns when you lack gems for [`Payback`][card-payback]. |
| [`Leeches`][card-leeches] | 0 / Starter | Sustain | Produces `Healing Drops` to manage HP. |
| [`Cover`][card-cover] | 1 / Common | Block | Protects while playing around low HP thresholds. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Tit for Tat`][card-tit-for-tat], [`Double Cut`][card-double-cut], or artifact-added bombs for extra burst. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound] + [`Necrotize`][card-necrotize] from 50% HP wipes 20 HP elites instantly.
- [`Payback`][card-payback] refunds mana at 4+ gems, enabling double-stun turns even late in Act III.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Communicate reposition plays so allies don’t waste movement; you can yank bosses/packs into safe lanes.
- Keep one stun for boss thresholds—being able to [`Payback`][card-payback] the boss mid-phase keeps your HP manipulation safe.
- Allies with freeze/stun add-ons (Mage, Tinkerer) help trigger dagger bonuses; coordinate to chain crowd control.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to heal after HP-cost attacks—always follow [`Leeches`][card-leeches]/`Sangria` after big bursts.
- Playing [`Kick`][card-kick] last; you may accidentally move the target out of dagger range.
- Keeping too many non-dagger cards; this build needs tight draw density to function reliably.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
