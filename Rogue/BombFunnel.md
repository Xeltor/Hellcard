# Rogue Bomb Funnel Saboteur (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Medium (9/15) – detonation timing is forgiving, but sustaining gem economy for repeated bombs across 12 floors needs attention.
- **Win condition**: stockpile bombs (`Cornucopia`, `Bouncy Bomb`, `Precision Bomb`), herd enemies with `Kick`, then ignite waves with `Ignite`/`Flashbang Bomb` while allies finish stunned survivors.[1][2][3][4]
- **Best in**: back slot control—keeps elite packs controlled and feeds unblockable damage in co-op.
- **Key stats**: a single `Flashbang Bomb` deals 8 damage + stun to an entire section; following with `Minesweep` or `Buster Bomb` deletes defensive elites.

## Core Loop
1. Deploy bombs via `Cornucopia`, `Dig` (if drawn), or artifact triggers; place them on the lanes allies want to clear.[1][2]
2. Use `Kick`, `Loaded Die`, or ally reposition tools to cluster enemies on bombed tiles.[5][6]
3. Detonate with `Ignite`, `Minesweep`, or `Flashbang Bomb`, then immediately reseed bombs to maintain pressure.

## Draft Priorities
- **Bomb generators**: `Cornucopia`, `Dig`, `Zero In` (for Quarrels if cross-synergy), any artifact-provided bombs.[1][2][7]
- **Detonators**: `Ignite`, `Minesweep`, `Flashbang Bomb`, `Buster Bomb` – grab multiple to avoid bricked turns.[3][4][8]
- **Control tools**: `Kick`, `Payback`, `Akanbe` to herd or lock enemies onto bomb tiles.[5][9]
- **Support**: `Cover`, `Luck`, `Teamwork` keep you alive and draw into bombs faster.[10][11]
- **Removals**: cut basic daggers once bombs become primary damage; keep a couple for finishing stray runners.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Cornucopia` (adds better bomb picks) and `Flashbang Bomb` (higher damage); follow with `Payback` for reliable stuns.[1][4][9]
- **Hideout**: remove unneeded attacks, Plan `Cornucopia`, and funnel gems to the Rogue until 4+ so `Payback` refunds fuel repeated control loops.[12]
- **Vaults**: optional—take them only after key bomb pieces are secured; the build relies on gem savings for Armory and artifact purchases first.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Grabber` – adds a random bomb to hand every turn, perfectly feeding the loop.[13]
- `Salt` – offers periodic mana refunds, smoothing detonation turns.[14]
- `Golden Onion` – provides passive HP sustain while you wait for bomb draws.[15]
- `Horse's Head` – tosses in `Death Mark` and `Osoto Gari`, helping focus damage on bombed targets.[16]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Place bombs before repositioning; it’s easier to herd enemies onto a waiting bomb than vice versa.[5]
- `Kick` moves enemies from near to far—pair it with `Precision Bomb` or `Flashbang Bomb` to make sure high-Strength foes get caught.[5][3]
- Use `Payback` to hold dangerous foes in place while you set up bombs; the mana refund at 4 gems keeps the chain going.[9]
- Communicate bombed lanes in co-op so allies delay AOEs until after detonation for maximum damage.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Cornucopia` ×2 | 1 / Rare | Bomb supply | Constantly feeds bombs + Ignite.[1]
| `Flashbang Bomb` | 0 / Rare | AOE stun | Reliable lane wipe and setup for allies.[3]
| `Buster Bomb` | 0 / Rare | Block breaker | Clears armored elites; pair with `Kick`.[8]
| `Ignite` | 1 / Summoned | Detonator | Keep one in hand; upgrade if possible for lower cost.[3]
| `Minesweep` | 0 / Legendary | Follow-up | Sweeps bombed lanes; best used after Flashbang.[4]
| `Kick` | 0 / Common | Position | Slide enemies onto bombs.[5]
| `Payback` | 1 / Common | Stun + refund | Locks enemies while bombs arm.[9]
| Flex: `Golden Onion`, `Salt`, or artifact cards | — | Utility | Adds sustain or extra bomb combos.[14][15]

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Flashbang Bomb` + `Minesweep` deals 8 + (section size ×2) damage and stuns, enough to erase 10–12 HP elites.
- `Buster Bomb` handles shielded foes; follow with allies to capitalize on broken block.[8]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Inform teammates where bombs are primed; they can herd enemies or hold AOEs until after detonation.
- Boss adds spawn? Pre-place `Flashbang Bomb` on the spawn tile; detonate the moment they appear to avoid taking damage.
- Maintain `Payback` for emergency stuns during boss thresholds, especially when gems ensure refunds.

## Common Pitfalls
- Detonating too early; let enemies stack on bombs for maximum value.
- Running out of bombs because `Cornucopia` wasn’t upgraded—prioritize Armory visits.
- Ignoring survivability; keep `Cover`/`Luck` in deck so you don’t die waiting for bombs to recycle.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
