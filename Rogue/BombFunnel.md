# Rogue Bomb Funnel Saboteur (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Medium (9/15) – detonation timing is forgiving, but sustaining gem economy for repeated bombs across 12 floors needs attention.
- **Win condition**: stockpile bombs ([`Cornucopia`][card-cornucopia], `Bouncy Bomb`, `Precision Bomb`), herd enemies with [`Kick`][card-kick], then ignite waves with `Ignite`/[`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] while allies finish stunned survivors.
- **Best in**: back slot control—keeps elite packs controlled and feeds unblockable damage in co-op.
- **Key stats**: a single [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] deals 8 damage + stun to an entire section; following with [`Minesweep`][card-minesweep] or [`Buster Bomb`][card-buster-bomb] deletes defensive elites.

## Core Loop
1. Deploy bombs via [`Cornucopia`][card-cornucopia], [`Dig`][card-dig] (if drawn), or artifact triggers; place them on the lanes allies want to clear.
2. Use [`Kick`][card-kick], [`Loaded Die`][card-loaded-die], or ally reposition tools to cluster enemies on bombed tiles.
3. Detonate with `Ignite`, [`Minesweep`][card-minesweep], or [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb], then immediately reseed bombs to maintain pressure.

## Draft Priorities
- **Bomb generators**: [`Cornucopia`][card-cornucopia], [`Dig`][card-dig], `Zero In` (for Quarrels if cross-synergy), any artifact-provided bombs.
- **Detonators**: `Ignite`, [`Minesweep`][card-minesweep], [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb], [`Buster Bomb`][card-buster-bomb] – grab multiple to avoid bricked turns.
- **Control tools**: [`Kick`][card-kick], [`Payback`][card-payback], `Akanbe` to herd or lock enemies onto bomb tiles.
- **Support**: [`Cover`][card-cover], `Luck`, [`Teamwork`][card-teamwork] keep you alive and draw into bombs faster.
- **Removals**: cut basic daggers once bombs become primary damage; keep a couple for finishing stray runners.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Cornucopia`][card-cornucopia] (adds better bomb picks) and [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] (higher damage); follow with [`Payback`][card-payback] for reliable stuns.
- **Hideout**: remove unneeded attacks, Plan [`Cornucopia`][card-cornucopia], and funnel gems to the Rogue until 4+ so [`Payback`][card-payback] refunds fuel repeated control loops.
- **Vaults**: optional—take them only after key bomb pieces are secured; the build relies on gem savings for Armory and artifact purchases first.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Grabber`][card-grabber] – adds a random bomb to hand every turn, perfectly feeding the loop.
- [`Salt`][card-salt] – offers periodic mana refunds, smoothing detonation turns.
- [`Golden Onion`][card-golden-onion] – provides passive HP sustain while you wait for bomb draws.
- [`Horse's Head`][card-horses-head] – tosses in `Death Mark` and `Osoto Gari`, helping focus damage on bombed targets.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Place bombs before repositioning; it’s easier to herd enemies onto a waiting bomb than vice versa.
- [`Kick`][card-kick] moves enemies from near to far—pair it with `Precision Bomb` or [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] to make sure high-Strength foes get caught.
- Use [`Payback`][card-payback] to hold dangerous foes in place while you set up bombs; the mana refund at 4 gems keeps the chain going.
- Communicate bombed lanes in co-op so allies delay AOEs until after detonation for maximum damage.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Cornucopia`][card-cornucopia] ×2 | 1 / Rare | Bomb supply | Constantly feeds bombs + Ignite.
| [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] | 0 / Rare | AOE stun | Reliable lane wipe and setup for allies.
| [`Buster Bomb`][card-buster-bomb] | 0 / Rare | Block breaker | Clears armored elites; pair with [`Kick`][card-kick].
| `Ignite` | 1 / Summoned | Detonator | Keep one in hand; upgrade if possible for lower cost.
| [`Minesweep`][card-minesweep] | 0 / Legendary | Follow-up | Sweeps bombed lanes; best used after Flashbang.
| [`Kick`][card-kick] | 0 / Common | Position | Slide enemies onto bombs.
| [`Payback`][card-payback] | 1 / Common | Stun + refund | Locks enemies while bombs arm.
| Flex: [`Golden Onion`][card-golden-onion], [`Salt`][card-salt], or artifact cards | — | Utility | Adds sustain or extra bomb combos.

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] + [`Minesweep`][card-minesweep] deals 8 + (section size ×2) damage and stuns, enough to erase 10–12 HP elites.
- [`Buster Bomb`][card-buster-bomb] handles shielded foes; follow with allies to capitalize on broken block.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Inform teammates where bombs are primed; they can herd enemies or hold AOEs until after detonation.
- Boss adds spawn? Pre-place [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] on the spawn tile; detonate the moment they appear to avoid taking damage.
- Maintain [`Payback`][card-payback] for emergency stuns during boss thresholds, especially when gems ensure refunds.

## Common Pitfalls
- Detonating too early; let enemies stack on bombs for maximum value.
- Running out of bombs because [`Cornucopia`][card-cornucopia] wasn’t upgraded—prioritize Armory visits.
- Ignoring survivability; keep [`Cover`][card-cover]/`Luck` in deck so you don’t die waiting for bombs to recycle.

## Changelog
