# Rogue Blade Waltz Duelist (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: loop [`Scissor Strike`][card-scissor-strike], [`Mordhau`][card-mordhau], and [`Mad Skills`][card-mad-skills] to stack combo damage while refunding stamina through cheap repostes.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (9/15) – sequencing takes a few runs to master, but the deck runs mostly on commons and rares.
- **Best in**: mid lane solo or co-op; it thrives when allies keep elites pinned so you can dance in and out of melee.
- **Key stats**: upgraded [`Scissor Strike`][card-scissor-strike] lands 8 damage after combo scaling, and [`Mad Skills`][card-mad-skills] keeps your hand full without exhausting stamina.

## Core Loop
1. Open with zero/one-cost enablers ([`Improvise`][card-improvise], [`Backflip`][card-backflip]) to trigger combo and stack block before diving in.
2. Chain [`Scissor Strike`][card-scissor-strike] and [`Mordhau`][card-mordhau] for high single-target damage, then finish with [`Maximum Effort`][card-maximum-effort] when stamina peaks.
3. Use [`Breath Control`][card-breath-control] to reset stamina and go again while [`Payback`][card-payback] guards you from surprise hits.

## Draft Priorities
- **Combo starters**: duplicate [`Improvise`][card-improvise], [`Backflip`][card-backflip], and [`Mad Skills`][card-mad-skills] so every turn begins with free triggers.
- **Finishers**: [`Scissor Strike`][card-scissor-strike], [`Mordhau`][card-mordhau], and [`Maximum Effort`][card-maximum-effort] build lethal turns; upgrade [`Scissor Strike`][card-scissor-strike] first.
- **Utility**: [`Breath Control`][card-breath-control] for stamina, [`Payback`][card-payback] for reactive stuns, and one `Deflect` or `Cover` when you need block density.
- **Removals**: cut slow bombs and duplicate daggers—this build wants light hands with 0–1 cost plays.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Scissor Strike`][card-scissor-strike] early, then [`Mad Skills`][card-mad-skills] so it draws two; [`Mordhau`][card-mordhau] comes third once damage feels light.
- **Hideout**: pin [`Improvise`][card-improvise] or [`Mad Skills`][card-mad-skills] with **Plan**, remove redundant bombs, and buy stamina artifacts if available.
- **Vaults**: take only when you can protect HP; the combo already scales without legendaries, so skip risky detours.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Chainshirt`][card-chainshirt] – converts early block cards into permanent block boosts, letting you stay in melee longer.
- [`Veteran Pin`][card-veteran-pin] – adds [`Maximum Effort`][card-maximum-effort] and refunds stamina when you empty your hand, perfect for combo turns.
- [`Golden Onion`][card-golden-onion] – chip healing keeps the Rogue healthy through longer boss phases.
- [`Box`][card-box] – extra draw makes finding starters ([`Improvise`][card-improvise], [`Backflip`][card-backflip]) consistent.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Lead with zero-cost combo cards before committing stamina; the damage jump between combo tiers is huge.
- [`Breath Control`][card-breath-control] should come after your biggest hit—refill stamina and re-open with fresh combo pieces.
- Hold [`Payback`][card-payback] if an elite is about to swing; stunning at the right time preserves HP and keeps the tempo.
- Co-op: ask allies to set up knockbacks so [`Mordhau`][card-mordhau] always lands on a near target.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Scissor Strike`][card-scissor-strike] ×2 | 1 / Common | Primary damage | Upgrade for +3 damage at combo tier 3. |
| [`Mordhau`][card-mordhau] | 1 / Rare | Heavy finisher | Great vs armored elites; take second copy if offered. |
| [`Mad Skills`][card-mad-skills] ×2 | 0 / Common | Combo fuel | Draw + stamina keeps hands flowing. |
| [`Improvise`][card-improvise] | 0 / Common | Combo starter | Free block + draw to light the chain. |
| [`Backflip`][card-backflip] | 0 / Common | Self-peel | Keeps you safe when turns misfire. |
| [`Maximum Effort`][card-maximum-effort] | 2 / Rare | Burst | Spend stacked stamina for lethal spikes. |
| [`Breath Control`][card-breath-control] | 1 / Common | Sustain | Resets stamina after your big turn. |
| [`Payback`][card-payback] | 1 / Common | Safety | Emergency stun to stop attackers. |
| Flex slot | — | Tech | `Deflect`, `Cover`, or artifact-granted bombs depending on needs. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- Combo tier 3 [`Scissor Strike`][card-scissor-strike] → [`Mordhau`][card-mordhau] hits 18+ damage without artifacts.
- [`Maximum Effort`][card-maximum-effort] with full stamina (10+) clears most bosses once per cycle.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Feed combo triggers by sharing marks or bomb setups from allies—[`Mad Skills`][card-mad-skills] refunds stamina for the whole team in draw-heavy turns.
- On bosses with sweeping attacks, lead with [`Backflip`][card-backflip] for safety before re-engaging.
- If allies bring crowd control, save [`Payback`][card-payback] for the boss slam to prevent wipe scenarios.

## Common Pitfalls
- Playing [`Mordhau`][card-mordhau] before combo is active; always set combo tier first.
- Skipping block tech; even duelist builds need [`Backflip`][card-backflip] or `Deflect` for scary waves.
- Overdrawing without stamina management—use [`Breath Control`][card-breath-control] early in long fights to avoid passing empty.
