# Rogue Knife Juggler Volley (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: flood the board with free knives from [`Throw Knives`][card-throw-knives], [`Sharp Rain`][card-sharp-rain], and [`Arrow Split`][card-arrow-split], then recycle via [`Quick Draw`][card-quick-draw] into another volley.
- **Difficulty**: Low (8/15) – once the deck is slimmed down, turns become repeatable and safe.
- **Best in**: backline solo; excels at clearing wide waves and supporting allies with Mark stacks.
- **Key stats**: an upgraded [`Throw Knives`][card-throw-knives] fires five knives, and [`Sharp Rain`][card-sharp-rain] adds +1 per marked target.

## Core Loop
1. Use [`Zero in`][card-zero-in] and [`Quick Draw`][card-quick-draw] to load your hand with knives while marking targets.
2. Fire [`Throw Knives`][card-throw-knives]/[`Sharp Rain`][card-sharp-rain]; follow with [`Arrow Split`][card-arrow-split] or [`Barrage`][card-barrage] to finish survivors.
3. Repeat by redrawing with [`Quick Draw`][card-quick-draw] or artifact quivers, keeping distance with [`Deflect`][card-deflect] if enemies close in.

## Draft Priorities
- **Knife generators**: prioritize [`Throw Knives`][card-throw-knives], [`Sharp Rain`][card-sharp-rain], and [`Arrow Split`][card-arrow-split]; duplicates are welcome.
- **Reload tools**: [`Quick Draw`][card-quick-draw], [`Zero in`][card-zero-in], and [`Marked Deck`][card-marked-deck] maintain ammo flow.
- **Defense**: [`Deflect`][card-deflect] or `Cover` keep chip damage manageable while you reload.
- **Removals**: ditch melee daggers; the deck only needs ranged throws and support.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Throw Knives`][card-throw-knives] immediately, then [`Sharp Rain`][card-sharp-rain]; [`Quick Draw`][card-quick-draw] third for +2 draw.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Zero in`][card-zero-in], remove bombs/melee filler, and buy quiver artifacts when available.
- **Vaults**: optional—only dip once you have at least two upgraded generators.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Crossbow`][card-crossbow] – raises baseline dagger damage, multiplying each knife toss.
- [`Chainshirt`][card-chainshirt] – permanent block so you can stay planted in backline.
- [`Salt`][card-salt] – mana refunds let you cast multiple [`Sharp Rain`][card-sharp-rain] turns without passing.
- [`Grabber`][card-grabber] – extra bombs cover turn where knives run low.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Cast [`Zero in`][card-zero-in]/[`Quick Draw`][card-quick-draw] before spending knives; you want a full hand to avoid falling short on damage.
- Hold one [`Throw Knives`][card-throw-knives] for emergencies—bombs leave blind spots where knives finish the job safely.
- [`Deflect`][card-deflect] buys time if enemies rush; follow with [`Arrow Split`][card-arrow-split] to peel them back.
- Co-op: call marked targets so allies get bonus damage from your knife debuffs.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Throw Knives`][card-throw-knives] ×2 | 1 / Common | Primary damage | Upgrade for +2 knives and +1 damage each. |
| [`Sharp Rain`][card-sharp-rain] | 1 / Rare | Payoff | Scales with marks; take second copy if offered. |
| [`Arrow Split`][card-arrow-split] | 1 / Rare | Finisher | Deals with near/far split waves. |
| [`Barrage`][card-barrage] | 2 / Rare | Burst | Use when hand full of knives to nuke a lane. |
| [`Quick Draw`][card-quick-draw] ×2 | 0 / Common | Draw + marks | Keeps ammo and marks flowing. |
| [`Zero in`][card-zero-in] | 0 / Common | Quiver fill | Guarantees knives on key turns. |
| [`Marked Deck`][card-marked-deck] | 1 / Rare | Mark support | Optional but great vs bosses. |
| [`Deflect`][card-deflect] | 0 / Common | Defense | Mandatory safety valve. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | `Cover`, [`Salt`][card-salt] procs, or artifact quivers depending on drops. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Throw Knives`][card-throw-knives] + [`Sharp Rain`][card-sharp-rain] with marks deals 18–22 split damage on turn three.
- [`Barrage`][card-barrage] with full hand clears elite waves even without artifacts.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Share marks with allies; they gain +damage and accuracy on targeted enemies.
- Against bosses with damage shields, use [`Arrow Split`][card-arrow-split] to chip from both ranges while staying safe.
- Keep [`Deflect`][card-deflect] ready in case allies push bosses into your lane.

## Common Pitfalls
- Skipping draw—without [`Quick Draw`][card-quick-draw], hands stall and knives fizzle.
- Forgetting to upgrade [`Throw Knives`][card-throw-knives]; base version cannot keep pace with Act II HP pools.
- Overcommitting to bombs; you need at least eight knife pieces to stay consistent.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
