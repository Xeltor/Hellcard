# Rogue Mark Spin Support (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Low (6/15) – relaxed mark-and-stun rotation that comfortably carries through the 12-floor climb with minimal setup.
- **Win condition**: spread marks with [`Death Mark`][card-death-mark]/[`Loaded Die`][card-loaded-die], stun priority targets via [`Payback`][card-payback]/[`*Bonk*`][card-bonk], and finish them using cheap daggers while allies capitalize on the +1 damage bonus.
- **Best in**: mid/back slots in solo or co-op; the deck protects the team and chips down elites reliably.
- **Key stats**: a marked enemy takes +1 damage from all attacks; with two marks up, ally hits gain +2 each, multiplying team DPS quickly.

## Core Loop
1. Apply marks every turn through [`Death Mark`][card-death-mark], [`Loaded Die`][card-loaded-die], or [`Marked Deck`][card-marked-deck] if available; keep at least one target marked at all times.
2. Stun or control the marked enemy with [`Payback`][card-payback] (mana refund at 4+ gems) or [`*Bonk*`][card-bonk], buying time for setup.
3. Finish with basic attacks or ally AOEs while maintaining marks and stuns to lock down dangerous foes.

## Draft Priorities
- **Mark generators**: [`Death Mark`][card-death-mark], [`Loaded Die`][card-loaded-die], [`Paint Balloon`][card-paint-balloon] for wider mark coverage.
- **Control suite**: [`Payback`][card-payback], [`*Bonk*`][card-bonk], [`Kick`][card-kick] – these lock enemies or reposition them into ally lanes.
- **Utility**: [`Cover`][card-cover] and `Buckler` add cheap block; [`Teamwork`][card-teamwork] keeps allied hands fresh.
- **Optional payoffs**: [`Marked Deck`][card-marked-deck] or [`Deadly Roulette`][card-deadly-roulette] to scale damage/mark density if they appear.
- **Removals**: trim low-impact starters (`Sharp Arrow`) once you’re marking consistently.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Death Mark`][card-death-mark] (adds extra mark) then [`Payback`][card-payback] for reliable stuns and refunds.
- **Hideout**: remove redundant attacks, use **Plan** to pin [`Death Mark`][card-death-mark], and gift gems until the Rogue hits 4 for [`Payback`][card-payback] loop consistency.
- **Vaults**: visit later once key marks/stuns are secured; early gem spends are better used on upgrades.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Salt`][card-salt] – legendary synergy with mark/stun loops; gives 1 mana every fifth summoned card, smoothing turns.
- [`Horse's Head`][card-horses-head] – adds [`Death Mark`][card-death-mark] + `Osoto Gari`, giving both mark and block-break tools in one pickup.
- [`Key`][card-key] – +1 opener mana helps chain [`Death Mark`][card-death-mark] → [`Payback`][card-payback] on turn one.
- [`Golden Onion`][card-golden-onion] – drip-feeds HP for survivability during longer mark setups.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Apply mark first, then fire attacks/stuns so every hit benefits from the +1 damage bonus.
- [`Payback`][card-payback] refunds mana at 4+ gems; hold it for critical turns to chain multiple stuns/daggers.
- [`Kick`][card-kick] moves dangerous enemies to far range, buying time while marks accumulate.
- Coordinate with allies: call out marked targets so they focus damage efficiently.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Death Mark`][card-death-mark] ×2 | 1 / Common | Primary mark source | Upgrade for double marks when possible. |
| [`Loaded Die`][card-loaded-die] | 0 / Common | Free mark | Adds random mark, great filler. |
| [`Payback`][card-payback] | 1 / Common | Stun + refund | Mana refunds at 4+ gems keep turns flowing. |
| [`*Bonk*`][card-bonk] | 1 / Common | Extra stun | Backup control when gem count is low. |
| [`Kick`][card-kick] | 0 / Common | Position control | Useful in co-op to reposition threats. |
| [`Cover`][card-cover] or `Buckler` | 1 / Common/Starter | Block | Keep yourself safe while setting up marks. |
| [`Teamwork`][card-teamwork] | 1 / Common | Team draw | Helps allies capitalize on marks faster. |
| Flex slots | — | Utility | [`Paint Balloon`][card-paint-balloon], [`Deadly Roulette`][card-deadly-roulette], or artifact-added cards depending on finds. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- Single mark → +1 damage per hit; with two marks ([`Paint Balloon`][card-paint-balloon]), allies get +2 per strike, massively boosting multi-hit builds.
- [`Payback`][card-payback] stun loop keeps elites from acting while marks stack, letting you clear them without taking damage.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Call out marked bosses so teammates burst at the right time; the +damage stacks multiply their heavy hits.
- Maintain [`Payback`][card-payback] for emergency stuns when boss thresholds trigger; gem funnels from allies help guarantee the refund.
- Use [`Kick`][card-kick] to keep bosses in ally kill zones after a stun.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to mark before attacking; always lead with mark cards to maximize team damage.
- Over-spending gems early; prioritize hitting the 4-gem threshold for [`Payback`][card-payback] before splurging elsewhere.
- Standing too close without block – keep [`Cover`][card-cover]/`Buckler` on hand to avoid chip damage while lining up stuns.
