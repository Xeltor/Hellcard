# Rogue Mark Spin Support (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Medium (8/15) – mark-and-stun rotation stays simple, but soloing all 12 floors demands consistent mark uptime and careful gem management.
- **Win condition**: spread marks with `Death Mark`/`Loaded Die`, stun priority targets via `Payback`/`*Bonk*`, and finish them using cheap daggers while allies capitalize on the +1 damage bonus.[1][2][3][4]
- **Best in**: mid/back slots in solo or co-op; the deck protects the team and chips down elites reliably.
- **Key stats**: a marked enemy takes +1 damage from all attacks; with two marks up, ally hits gain +2 each, multiplying team DPS quickly.

## Core Loop
1. Apply marks every turn through `Death Mark`, `Loaded Die`, or `Marked Deck` if available; keep at least one target marked at all times.[1][2]
2. Stun or control the marked enemy with `Payback` (mana refund at 4+ gems) or `*Bonk*`, buying time for setup.[3][4]
3. Finish with basic attacks or ally AOEs while maintaining marks and stuns to lock down dangerous foes.

## Draft Priorities
- **Mark generators**: `Death Mark`, `Loaded Die`, `Paint Balloon` for wider mark coverage.[1][2][5]
- **Control suite**: `Payback`, `*Bonk*`, `Kick` – these lock enemies or reposition them into ally lanes.[3][4][6]
- **Utility**: `Cover` and `Buckler` add cheap block; `Teamwork` keeps allied hands fresh.[7][8]
- **Optional payoffs**: `Marked Deck` or `Deadly Roulette` to scale damage/mark density if they appear.[9][10]
- **Removals**: trim low-impact starters (`Sharp Arrow`) once you’re marking consistently.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Death Mark` (adds extra mark) then `Payback` for reliable stuns and refunds.[1][3]
- **Hideout**: remove redundant attacks, use **Plan** to pin `Death Mark`, and gift gems until the Rogue hits 4 for `Payback` loop consistency.[11]
- **Vaults**: visit later once key marks/stuns are secured; early gem spends are better used on upgrades.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Salt` – legendary synergy with mark/stun loops; gives 1 mana every fifth summoned card, smoothing turns.[12]
- `Horse's Head` – adds `Death Mark` + `Osoto Gari`, giving both mark and block-break tools in one pickup.[13]
- `Key` – +1 opener mana helps chain `Death Mark` → `Payback` on turn one.[14]
- `Golden Onion` – drip-feeds HP for survivability during longer mark setups.[15]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Apply mark first, then fire attacks/stuns so every hit benefits from the +1 damage bonus.[1]
- `Payback` refunds mana at 4+ gems; hold it for critical turns to chain multiple stuns/daggers.[3]
- `Kick` moves dangerous enemies to far range, buying time while marks accumulate.[6]
- Coordinate with allies: call out marked targets so they focus damage efficiently.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Death Mark` ×2 | 1 / Common | Primary mark source | Upgrade for double marks when possible.[1] |
| `Loaded Die` | 0 / Common | Free mark | Adds random mark, great filler.[2] |
| `Payback` | 1 / Common | Stun + refund | Mana refunds at 4+ gems keep turns flowing.[3] |
| `*Bonk*` | 1 / Common | Extra stun | Backup control when gem count is low.[4] |
| `Kick` | 0 / Common | Position control | Useful in co-op to reposition threats.[6] |
| `Cover` or `Buckler` | 1 / Common/Starter | Block | Keep yourself safe while setting up marks.[7] |
| `Teamwork` | 1 / Common | Team draw | Helps allies capitalize on marks faster.[8] |
| Flex slots | — | Utility | `Paint Balloon`, `Deadly Roulette`, or artifact-added cards depending on finds.[5][10] |

## Damage Benchmarks
- Single mark → +1 damage per hit; with two marks (`Paint Balloon`), allies get +2 per strike, massively boosting multi-hit builds.
- `Payback` stun loop keeps elites from acting while marks stack, letting you clear them without taking damage.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Call out marked bosses so teammates burst at the right time; the +damage stacks multiply their heavy hits.
- Maintain `Payback` for emergency stuns when boss thresholds trigger; gem funnels from allies help guarantee the refund.
- Use `Kick` to keep bosses in ally kill zones after a stun.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to mark before attacking; always lead with mark cards to maximize team damage.
- Over-spending gems early; prioritize hitting the 4-gem threshold for `Payback` before splurging elsewhere.
- Standing too close without block – keep `Cover`/`Buckler` on hand to avoid chip damage while lining up stuns.

## Changelog
