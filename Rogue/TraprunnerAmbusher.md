# Rogue Traprunner Ambusher (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: plant traps with [`Minesweep`][card-minesweep], [`Precision Bomb`][card-precision-bomb], and [`Paint Balloon`][card-paint-balloon], then herd enemies onto them for chained detonations.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (10/15) – requires positional awareness and patient turns but relies on accessible rares.
- **Best in**: co-op frontline support; pairs great with Warriors who can shove enemies onto your trap tiles.
- **Key stats**: [`Precision Bomb`][card-precision-bomb] upgrades to 10 damage in a small zone, and [`Paint Balloon`][card-paint-balloon] marks the lane so follow-up arrows hit harder.

## Core Loop
1. Set trap tiles early using [`Minesweep`][card-minesweep]/[`Precision Bomb`][card-precision-bomb], then stall with `Cover`/[`Keeping Distance`][card-keeping-distance].
2. Use [`Kick`][card-kick], [`Flash`][card-flash], or ally knockbacks to push targets onto armed tiles.
3. Detonate with [`Shrapnel`][card-shrapnel] or let delayed bombs explode naturally while you prep the next wave.

## Draft Priorities
- **Trap suite**: grab every [`Minesweep`][card-minesweep], [`Precision Bomb`][card-precision-bomb], [`Paint Balloon`][card-paint-balloon]; upgrade [`Precision Bomb`][card-precision-bomb] first for reliability.
- **Control tools**: [`Kick`][card-kick], [`Flash`][card-flash], `Knockback`, and [`Eagle's Eye`][card-eagles-eye] keep enemies in trap lanes and adds mark value.
- **Defense**: [`Keeping Distance`][card-keeping-distance], `Cover`, and [`Deflect`][card-deflect] prevent chip while traps arm.
- **Removals**: heavy attacks and melee daggers slow the deck—keep the list lean and reactive.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Precision Bomb`][card-precision-bomb], then [`Minesweep`][card-minesweep]; [`Paint Balloon`][card-paint-balloon] third for longer mark duration.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Minesweep`][card-minesweep], dump stray bombs that don’t synergise, invest gems into artifact economy (Grabber/Salt).
- **Vaults**: good once you own at least two upgraded traps—look for legendary bombs like `Flashbang` to extend control.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Grabber`][card-grabber] – free bombs that can be kicked into clusters for extra detonations.
- [`Salt`][card-salt] – refund mana on double-bomb turns so you can still defend.
- [`Golden Onion`][card-golden-onion] – sustain during setup phases when bombs delay kills.
- [`Brass Cog`][card-brass-cog] – free potion at start often yields extra trap or block options.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Plant first, move later: laying [`Minesweep`][card-minesweep] after you push enemies wastes tiles.
- Use [`Paint Balloon`][card-paint-balloon] before [`Precision Bomb`][card-precision-bomb]; marks amplify the follow-up trap damage and ally hits.
- Hold [`Kick`][card-kick] for elites that resist movement—you may need two pushes to drag them onto a tile.
- Co-op: coordinate with Warriors/Tinkerers who have pulls; call out which tiles are armed.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Minesweep`][card-minesweep] ×2 | 1 / Rare | Trap setup | Upgrade for +2 damage and faster arm time. |
| [`Precision Bomb`][card-precision-bomb] ×2 | 1 / Rare | Focused trap | Drops huge damage on marked lanes. |
| [`Paint Balloon`][card-paint-balloon] | 1 / Rare | Mark support | Sets up future cone/arrow hits. |
| [`Kick`][card-kick] | 0 / Common | Position control | Essential for forcing detonations. |
| [`Flash`][card-flash] | 0 / Common | Reposition | Draw + mobility when enemies close in. |
| [`Eagle's Eye`][card-eagles-eye] | 0 / Rare | Mark + draw | Helps line up trap kills at range. |
| [`Keeping Distance`][card-keeping-distance] | 1 / Common | Defense | Block + draw buys time while traps arm. |
| [`Shrapnel`][card-shrapnel] | 1 / Common | Detonation | Forces mines to go off instantly when needed. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Deflect`][card-deflect], `Flashbang Bomb`, or artifact bombs depending on drops. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- Double [`Precision Bomb`][card-precision-bomb] on a marked lane hits 18–20 damage plus mark bonus.
- [`Minesweep`][card-minesweep] into [`Shrapnel`][card-shrapnel] wipes 10 HP waves once traps arm.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Ask allies with pulls (Warrior `Akanbe`, Mage `Telekinetic Grasp`) to feed enemies onto bombs.
- Bosses often ignore traps—plan to supplement with [`Shrapnel`][card-shrapnel] when they move unpredictably.
- Share [`Brass Cog`][card-brass-cog] brews if teammates need mana/defense while you set traps.

## Common Pitfalls
- Overcommitting to bombs without movement tools—always draft at least two pushes/pulls.
- Forgetting trap arm time; protect yourself while waiting or you’ll take unnecessary hits.
- Skipping upgrades; base [`Precision Bomb`][card-precision-bomb] misses elite thresholds in Act III.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
