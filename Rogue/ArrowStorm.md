# Rogue Arrow Storm Sharpshooter (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: cycle arrow generators (`Quiver`, `Zero in`) and multi-shot payoffs (`Clockwork Arrow`, `Multi Arrow`) to blanket far lanes.[1][2][3]
- **Difficulty**: Medium (10/15) – sequencing is forgiving, but keeping enough arrows flowing for 12 floors means investing in upgrades and keeping the deck trim.
- **Best in**: backline solo or co-op; thrives when allies hold enemies at range so arrows can cleave safely.
- **Key stats**: upgraded `Quiver` spits out three `Talon Arrows`; combining it with `Multi Arrow` or `Sick & Tired Arrow` deletes elite packs without spending gems.

## Core Loop
1. Generate arrows every turn using `Quiver`, `Zero in`, and artifact-fed quivers.[1][2]
2. Use `Clockwork Arrow`/`Multi Arrow` as repeatable far-range clears, then finish survivors with `Chainshot Arrow` or daggers.[3][4]
3. Maintain utility cards (`Kick`, `Cover`) so enemies stay far and allies remain safe while you load the next volley.[5][6]

## Draft Priorities
- **Arrow economy**: duplicate `Quiver`, take `Zero in`, and pick up `Marked Deck`/`Paint Balloon` only if you want extra mark synergy.[1][2][7]
- **Payoffs**: `Multi Arrow`, `Chainshot Arrow`, `Sick & Tired Arrow`, `Piercing Arrow` escalate damage or add stuns.[3][4][8][9]
- **Support**: `Kick` for positioning, `Cover`/`Buckler` for survivability, and `Payback` as an emergency stun when enemies slip through.[5][6][10]
- **Removals**: trim daggers once arrow density is high; keep one close-range card for bosses that jump in.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: first upgrade `Quiver`, then `Multi Arrow`; follow with `Chainshot Arrow` for longer chains.[1][3][4]
- **Hideout**: remove excess melee cards, Plan `Quiver` for reliable openers, and funnel gems until you can afford arrow relics (`Crossbow`, `Grabber`).[11]
- **Vaults**: safe once core arrows are upgraded; early gems are better spent on upgrades and artifact shops.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Crossbow` – transforms starter arrows into `Quality Quarrels`, a major damage bump.[12]
- `Grabber` – generates random bombs that combo with `Kick` to create unblockable clears when arrows alone aren’t enough.[13]
- `Salt` – occasional mana refunds keep arrow turns flowing even when draws are clunky.[14]
- `Golden Onion` – chip healing smooths long campaigns where you take incidental hits.[15]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Lead with generators (`Quiver`, `Zero in`) before casting `Multi Arrow`; you want fresh arrows available for follow-up assassinates.[1][3]
- Use `Kick` to maintain far distance—your `Clockwork Arrow` hits harder from safety.[5]
- Save `Chainshot Arrow` for chains of low-HP enemies; arrange kills with prior hits so the chain doesn’t stop early.[4]
- In co-op, announce when a section is prepped with arrows/bombs so teammates bait enemies into the kill zone.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Quiver` ×2 | 1 / Common | Arrow supply | Upgrade for +3 `Talon Arrows` per cast.[1] |
| `Zero in` | 0 / Common | Additional arrows | Pull Quarrels for multi-shot turns.[2] |
| `Clockwork Arrow` | 1 / Common | Repeatable damage | Bread-and-butter far hit.[3] |
| `Multi Arrow` | 1 / Rare | Burst payoff | Fires two Clockwork Arrows; upgrade early.[3] |
| `Chainshot Arrow` | 1 / Legendary | Cleanup | Chains kills to clear whole lanes.[4] |
| `Sick & Tired Arrow` or `Piercing Arrow` | 1 / Rare/Legendary | Utility | Unblockable/stun options when elites approach.[8][9] |
| `Kick` | 0 / Common | Position control | Keep enemies in arrow range.[5] |
| `Cover` | 1 / Common | Block | Protects you while reloading arrows.[6] |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | `Paint Balloon`, `Payback`, or artifact-granted tools as needed.[7][10] |

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Multi Arrow` + upgraded `Quiver` delivers 6–8 damage per target, enough to clear Floor 6 minions in one cast.[3]
- `Chainshot Arrow` deletes lines of 6-HP enemies when preceded by `Clockwork Arrow` chip damage.[4]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Feed quivers to allies by calling marked targets; their attacks gain +damage when you splash marks/bombs.
- Boss phases: hold `Piercing Arrow` for unblockable hits and use `Kick` to keep the boss in safe lanes.
- Share bombs from `Grabber` and coordinate detonation after pulling enemies onto them with `Kick`.

## Common Pitfalls
- Firing `Multi Arrow` before generating arrows leaves you in top-deck mode; always create ammo first.
- Ignoring block—keep `Cover` or `Buckler` handy or you’ll crumble to chip damage on long floors.[6]
- Letting arrow density drop below five generators; keep at least two `Quiver` effects to sustain the loop.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
