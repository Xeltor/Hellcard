# Rogue Arrow Storm Sharpshooter (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: cycle arrow generators ([`Quiver`][card-quiver], [`Zero in`][card-zero-in]) and multi-shot payoffs (`Clockwork Arrow`, [`Multi Arrow`][card-multi-arrow]) to blanket far lanes.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (10/15) – sequencing is forgiving, but keeping enough arrows flowing for 12 floors means investing in upgrades and keeping the deck trim.
- **Best in**: backline solo or co-op; thrives when allies hold enemies at range so arrows can cleave safely.
- **Key stats**: upgraded [`Quiver`][card-quiver] spits out three `Talon Arrows`; combining it with [`Multi Arrow`][card-multi-arrow] or [`Sick & Tired Arrow`][card-sick-tired-arrow] deletes elite packs without spending gems.

## Core Loop
1. Generate arrows every turn using [`Quiver`][card-quiver], [`Zero in`][card-zero-in], and artifact-fed quivers.
2. Use `Clockwork Arrow`/[`Multi Arrow`][card-multi-arrow] as repeatable far-range clears, then finish survivors with [`Chainshot Arrow`][card-chainshot-arrow] or daggers.
3. Maintain utility cards ([`Kick`][card-kick], [`Cover`][card-cover]) so enemies stay far and allies remain safe while you load the next volley.

## Draft Priorities
- **Arrow economy**: duplicate [`Quiver`][card-quiver], take [`Zero in`][card-zero-in], and pick up `Marked Deck`/[`Paint Balloon`][card-paint-balloon] only if you want extra mark synergy.
- **Payoffs**: [`Multi Arrow`][card-multi-arrow], [`Chainshot Arrow`][card-chainshot-arrow], [`Sick & Tired Arrow`][card-sick-tired-arrow], [`Piercing Arrow`][card-piercing-arrow] escalate damage or add stuns.
- **Support**: [`Kick`][card-kick] for positioning, [`Cover`][card-cover]/`Buckler` for survivability, and [`Payback`][card-payback] as an emergency stun when enemies slip through.
- **Removals**: trim daggers once arrow density is high; keep one close-range card for bosses that jump in.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: first upgrade [`Quiver`][card-quiver], then [`Multi Arrow`][card-multi-arrow]; follow with [`Chainshot Arrow`][card-chainshot-arrow] for longer chains.
- **Hideout**: remove excess melee cards, Plan [`Quiver`][card-quiver] for reliable openers, and funnel gems until you can afford arrow relics ([`Crossbow`][card-crossbow], [`Grabber`][card-grabber]).
- **Vaults**: safe once core arrows are upgraded; early gems are better spent on upgrades and artifact shops.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Crossbow`][card-crossbow] – transforms starter arrows into `Quality Quarrels`, a major damage bump.
- [`Grabber`][card-grabber] – generates random bombs that combo with [`Kick`][card-kick] to create unblockable clears when arrows alone aren’t enough.
- [`Salt`][card-salt] – occasional mana refunds keep arrow turns flowing even when draws are clunky.
- [`Golden Onion`][card-golden-onion] – chip healing smooths long campaigns where you take incidental hits.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Lead with generators ([`Quiver`][card-quiver], [`Zero in`][card-zero-in]) before casting [`Multi Arrow`][card-multi-arrow]; you want fresh arrows available for follow-up assassinates.
- Use [`Kick`][card-kick] to maintain far distance—your `Clockwork Arrow` hits harder from safety.
- Save [`Chainshot Arrow`][card-chainshot-arrow] for chains of low-HP enemies; arrange kills with prior hits so the chain doesn’t stop early.
- In co-op, announce when a section is prepped with arrows/bombs so teammates bait enemies into the kill zone.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Quiver`][card-quiver] ×2 | 1 / Common | Arrow supply | Upgrade for +3 `Talon Arrows` per cast. |
| [`Zero in`][card-zero-in] | 0 / Common | Additional arrows | Pull Quarrels for multi-shot turns. |
| `Clockwork Arrow` | 1 / Common | Repeatable damage | Bread-and-butter far hit. |
| [`Multi Arrow`][card-multi-arrow] | 1 / Rare | Burst payoff | Fires two Clockwork Arrows; upgrade early. |
| [`Chainshot Arrow`][card-chainshot-arrow] | 1 / Legendary | Cleanup | Chains kills to clear whole lanes. |
| [`Sick & Tired Arrow`][card-sick-tired-arrow] or [`Piercing Arrow`][card-piercing-arrow] | 1 / Rare/Legendary | Utility | Unblockable/stun options when elites approach. |
| [`Kick`][card-kick] | 0 / Common | Position control | Keep enemies in arrow range. |
| [`Cover`][card-cover] | 1 / Common | Block | Protects you while reloading arrows. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Paint Balloon`][card-paint-balloon], [`Payback`][card-payback], or artifact-granted tools as needed. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Multi Arrow`][card-multi-arrow] + upgraded [`Quiver`][card-quiver] delivers 6–8 damage per target, enough to clear Floor 6 minions in one cast.
- [`Chainshot Arrow`][card-chainshot-arrow] deletes lines of 6-HP enemies when preceded by `Clockwork Arrow` chip damage.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Feed quivers to allies by calling marked targets; their attacks gain +damage when you splash marks/bombs.
- Boss phases: hold [`Piercing Arrow`][card-piercing-arrow] for unblockable hits and use [`Kick`][card-kick] to keep the boss in safe lanes.
- Share bombs from [`Grabber`][card-grabber] and coordinate detonation after pulling enemies onto them with [`Kick`][card-kick].

## Common Pitfalls
- Firing [`Multi Arrow`][card-multi-arrow] before generating arrows leaves you in top-deck mode; always create ammo first.
- Ignoring block—keep [`Cover`][card-cover] or `Buckler` handy or you’ll crumble to chip damage on long floors.
- Letting arrow density drop below five generators; keep at least two [`Quiver`][card-quiver] effects to sustain the loop.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
