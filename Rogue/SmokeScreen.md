# Rogue Smoke Screen Skirmisher (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: rotate stealth ([`Vanish`][card-vanish], [`Shadow Stance`][card-shadow-stance]) and blind bombs to deny enemy actions while stabbing safely from mid range.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (10/15) – relies on careful timing of stealth windows and bomb tosses, but uses mostly commons.
- **Best in**: co-op midline; excels at soft controlling elites so allies can focus damage.
- **Key stats**: [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] blinds entire lanes for 2 turns, and upgraded [`Shadow Stance`][card-shadow-stance] gives 6 block plus stealth to reset aggro.

## Core Loop
1. Enter stealth with [`Vanish`][card-vanish] or [`Shadow Stance`][card-shadow-stance], then drift into melee using [`Kick`][card-kick]/[`Knockback`][card-knockback] to align enemies.
2. Toss [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] or [`Bouncy Bomb`][card-bouncy-bomb] to blind and soften packs, finishing with daggers or `Shrapnel`.
3. Use [`Flash`][card-flash]/[`Keeping Distance`][card-keeping-distance] to reset position and draw into the next stealth cycle while staying safe.

## Draft Priorities
- **Stealth tools**: duplicate [`Vanish`][card-vanish], take [`Shadow Stance`][card-shadow-stance], and look for [`Flash`][card-flash] upgrades to extend stealth turns.
- **Control bombs**: [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb], [`Bouncy Bomb`][card-bouncy-bomb], and [`Kick`][card-kick] keep enemies disabled and lined up.
- **Defense**: `Cover` and [`Keeping Distance`][card-keeping-distance] provide reliable block when stealth is down.
- **Removals**: purge expensive burst cards; this build wins via pacing, not one-turn kills.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Shadow Stance`][card-shadow-stance] first, then [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] for longer blind duration.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Vanish`][card-vanish], remove stray bombs that don't blind, and pick up [`Flash`][card-flash] from influence if missing.
- **Vaults**: optional—stealth builds prefer consistent commons over risky legendary hunts.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Salt`][card-salt] – mana refunds let you cast [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] + [`Shadow Stance`][card-shadow-stance] in the same turn.
- [`Grabber`][card-grabber] – free bombs synergise with blind loops and trigger off [`Kick`][card-kick] repositioning.
- [`Horse's Head`][card-horses-head] – free [`Kick`][card-kick] each combat keeps enemies aligned for cone bombs.
- [`Golden Onion`][card-golden-onion] – offsets chip hits when stealth breaks at bad times.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Stealth first, bomb second: casting [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] before [`Vanish`][card-vanish] breaks stealth on impact.
- Use [`Kick`][card-kick] to push elites into blinded lanes; the debuff sticks even if they move.
- Keep one defensive card (`Cover`, [`Keeping Distance`][card-keeping-distance]) for turns when stealth cards hide near the bottom.
- Co-op: announce blind windows so allies dump big spells safely.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Vanish`][card-vanish] ×2 | 0 / Common | Stealth entry | Upgrade one for +2 block and longer stealth. |
| [`Shadow Stance`][card-shadow-stance] | 1 / Rare | Stealth sustain | Adds block while staying hidden. |
| [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] ×2 | 1 / Rare | Crowd control | Long-duration blind on whole lane. |
| [`Kick`][card-kick] | 0 / Common | Position control | Align cones and push elites into blind zones. |
| [`Knockback`][card-knockback] | 1 / Common | Lane drift | Keeps enemies grouped for bombs. |
| [`Flash`][card-flash] | 0 / Common | Draw + stealth | Helps find bombs immediately after vanishing. |
| [`Keeping Distance`][card-keeping-distance] | 1 / Common | Block + draw | Safety valve when stealth whiffs. |
| `Cover` | 1 / Common | Block | Guards you once stealth fades. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Bouncy Bomb`][card-bouncy-bomb], `Shrapnel`, or artifact cards depending on drops. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] + [`Bouncy Bomb`][card-bouncy-bomb] deals 6–10 splash while keeping enemies blind for two rounds.
- Upgraded [`Shadow Stance`][card-shadow-stance] + `Shrapnel` clears low-HP packs without exposing you.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Blind bosses before high-damage phases; coordinate with allies so they exploit the miss chance window.
- Offer stealth cover to squishy allies; [`Shadow Stance`][card-shadow-stance] can target them in co-op to hand off stealth.
- Save [`Kick`][card-kick] for mechanics like charging bosses that can still hit through blind without reposition.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting blind ends at your turn start; plan defense before stealth drops.
- Overloading bombs—without enough stealth cards, the build loses tempo fast.
- Ignoring artifact economy; [`Salt`][card-salt] or [`Grabber`][card-grabber] dramatically smooth turn sequencing.
