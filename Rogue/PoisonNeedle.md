# Rogue Poison Needle Alchemist (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: stack poison with [`Ivy Extract`][card-ivy-extract], [`Deadly Streak`][card-deadly-streak], and [`Hot Potato`][card-hot-potato] chains while staying alive behind tonic-fueled block.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (11/15) – requires juggling brew cards and tracking poison uptime, but scales with commons.
- **Best in**: co-op backline; pairs perfectly with allies that can stall while poison ticks.
- **Key stats**: upgraded [`Ivy Extract`][card-ivy-extract] applies 6 poison in a cone, and [`Deadly Streak`][card-deadly-streak] doubles stacks for lethal bursts.

## Core Loop
1. Apply baseline poison using [`Ivy Extract`][card-ivy-extract], [`Porcupine`][card-porcupine], and [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] conversions.
2. Double stacks with [`Deadly Streak`][card-deadly-streak], then pass [`Hot Potato`][card-hot-potato] between enemies for splash poison and delayed detonations.
3. Use [`Emergency Tonic`][card-emergency-tonic]/[`Bargain`][card-bargain] to draw into more brews while healing chip damage and gaining mana refunds.

## Draft Priorities
- **Poison base**: take every [`Ivy Extract`][card-ivy-extract], [`Porcupine`][card-porcupine], and [`Deadly Streak`][card-deadly-streak]; upgrade one [`Ivy Extract`][card-ivy-extract] immediately.
- **Spread tools**: [`Hot Potato`][card-hot-potato], [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb], and [`Garbage Day`][card-garbage-day] let poison touch entire waves.
- **Support brews**: [`Emergency Tonic`][card-emergency-tonic], [`Bargain`][card-bargain], and [`Forgery Kit`][card-forgery-kit] stabilize hand size and block.
- **Removals**: purge daggers and non-brew bombs so you always draw poison enablers.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: prioritize [`Ivy Extract`][card-ivy-extract], then [`Deadly Streak`][card-deadly-streak]; [`Hot Potato`][card-hot-potato] third for +2 splash poison.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Ivy Extract`][card-ivy-extract], remove stray melee cards, and spend gems on brew artifacts to keep sustain online.
- **Vaults**: worth the risk once core poison is online—legendary brews often push the deck over the top.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Brass Cog`][card-brass-cog] – free potion at combat start gives early poison spread.
- [`Crossbow`][card-crossbow] – turning daggers into `Quality Quarrels` adds safety damage while poison ticks.
- [`Box`][card-box] – card draw ensures brew chains never stall.
- [`Veteran Pin`][card-veteran-pin] – extra stamina pairs with brew spam for defensive turns.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Apply poison first, then double with [`Deadly Streak`][card-deadly-streak]; doubling zero adds nothing.
- Pass [`Hot Potato`][card-hot-potato] after doubling so each bounce inherits massive stacks.
- Drink [`Emergency Tonic`][card-emergency-tonic] before [`Bargain`][card-bargain] to keep HP safe while you dig for more poison cards.
- Co-op: call targets so allies avoid killing them before poison explodes; your payoff thrives on longer fights.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Ivy Extract`][card-ivy-extract] ×2 | 1 / Rare | Primary poison | Upgrade for +2 poison and larger cone. |
| [`Deadly Streak`][card-deadly-streak] ×2 | 1 / Common | Poison doubling | Stack before potato tosses. |
| [`Hot Potato`][card-hot-potato] | 1 / Common | Spread engine | Pass to refresh poison across lanes. |
| [`Porcupine`][card-porcupine] | 1 / Common | Passive stacks | Free poison every turn. |
| [`Flashbang Bomb`][card-flashbang-bomb] | 1 / Rare | Blind + poison | Converts blind to poison with artifacts. |
| [`Emergency Tonic`][card-emergency-tonic] | 0 / Common | Sustain | Heals + draw keeps you alive. |
| [`Bargain`][card-bargain] | 0 / Rare | Mana rebate | Offsets high poison costs. |
| [`Forgery Kit`][card-forgery-kit] | 1 / Rare | Brew copy | Duplicate the best potion or poison card. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Garbage Day`][card-garbage-day], `Shrapnel`, or artifact potions as needed. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- Double-stacked [`Ivy Extract`][card-ivy-extract] into [`Hot Potato`][card-hot-potato] hits 24+ poison over two turns.
- [`Porcupine`][card-porcupine] + [`Deadly Streak`][card-deadly-streak] passively builds 10 poison on elites by turn three.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Poison ignores block; great against shield bosses while allies handle adds.
- Share potions from [`Brass Cog`][card-brass-cog] with teammates if they need emergency heals.
- Maintain one blind effect for bosses with multi-hit turns even while poison is ticking.

## Common Pitfalls
- Doubling poison before enough stacks exist—wait until you have at least 6 on target.
- Overspending gems on damage artifacts; sustain ([`Brass Cog`][card-brass-cog], [`Box`][card-box]) keeps the engine alive.
- Forgetting [`Hot Potato`][card-hot-potato] bounces on deaths—set up lanes so the final bounce lands where you want.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
