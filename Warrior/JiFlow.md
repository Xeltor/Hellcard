# Warrior Ji Flow Duelist (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Medium (10/15) – positioning takes attention, but once Ji tools arrive you control far lanes all 12 floors.
- **Win condition**: cycle Ji attacks (`Ji Poke`, `Ji Thrust`, `Windmill Ji`) while using `Fulcrum Ji` and `Dragon Ji` to keep priority enemies at ideal range.[1][2][3][4][5]
- **Best in**: frontline or mid slot; excels at punishing far enemies and dragging elites into ally kill zones.
- **Key stats**: `Windmill Ji` scales with every Ji card in the deck; after a Foreign Coin upgrade you regularly deal 12+ damage cone hits from safety.

## Core Loop
1. Use `Fulcrum Ji`/`Outreach Ji` to swap dangerous enemies away from the party while banking block on draw.[1][4]
2. Strike from range with `Ji Poke`, `Ji Thrust`, and `Windmill Ji`, then finish stunned/frozen elites with `Sky Ji` or `Dragon Ji` combos.[2][3][5]
3. Reposition each turn so the frontline remains controlled, feeding allies clean targets and keeping your Ji bonuses active.

## Draft Priorities
- **Essentials**: duplicate `Ji Poke`/`Ji Thrust` for cheap far damage; grab `Fulcrum Ji` early to guarantee distance control.[1][2]
- **AoE payoffs**: `Windmill Ji`, `Ji Sweep`, `Sky Ji` become priority picks for elite/boss phases.[3][5][6]
- **Control tools**: `Akanbe`, `Percussive Maintenance`, and `Ribauldequin` add quick stuns when Ji draws lag.[7][8]
- **Support**: `Stretch` or `Second Wind` for stamina and block so you can tank hits while repositioning.[9][10]
- **Removals**: ditch short-range basics (`Sword Slash`, `Slam`) once the Ji package is online to avoid clunky draws.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Fulcrum Ji` (longer push + block on draw) then `Ji Poke`/`Ji Thrust` for higher base damage. Follow with `Windmill Ji` scaling if available.[1][2][3]
- **Hideout**: remove melee-only starters, Plan either `Fulcrum Ji` or `Windmill Ji`, and invest gems in Foreign Coin/Jack artifacts that enhance Ji lines.[11]
- **Vaults**: optional—take them once Ji cores are secured; otherwise focus on reliable upgrades and artifact shops.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Foreign Coin` (Warrior starter) rebuilds your deck entirely into Ji package—instant synergy if unlocked.[12]
- `Unripe Banana` converts leftover mana into block so you can stand near enemies while launching far attacks.[13]
- `Talking Scabbard` replaces `Sword Slash` with `Heavy Sword`, giving better close-range cleanup when needed.[14]
- `Jack` (Tinkerer artifact) isn’t class-specific but fits co-op runs, granting Screws/Cores if you dabble in contraptions via events.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Draw order matters: keep `Fulcrum Ji` ready before heavy attacks so you can reposition, then strike safely.[1]
- `Windmill Ji` adds block on draw proportional to Ji cards remaining—avoid over-thinning your deck so the bonus remains high.[3]
- When enemies are stunned/frozen, `Sky Ji` and `Ground Ji` reward you with stamina/block; coordinate with allies who can freeze (Mage) or stun (Rogue) for massive bursts.[5]
- Keep an eye on near-range threats; use `Akanbe` or `Kick` from allies to maintain distance if your Ji hand bricks.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Ji Poke` ×2 | 1 / Common | Core poke | Far damage + block on draw keeps you safe.[2]
| `Fulcrum Ji` | 1 / Common | Reposition | Moves monsters, grants block on draw.[1]
| `Ji Thrust` | 1 / Rare | Strong poke | Higher base damage + draw block buffer.[2]
| `Windmill Ji` | 2 / Legendary | AoE payoff | Damage scales with Ji count; upgrade when possible.[3]
| `Sky Ji` or `Ji Sweep` | 2 / Legendary | Elite/boss finisher | Huge damage vs stunned/frozen foes.[5][6]
| `Akanbe` | 1 / Common | Control | Pulls elites near allies for focused fire.[7]
| `Stretch` / `Second Wind` | 1 / Common/Rare | Sustain | Keeps stamina/mana flowing for repeated Ji casts.[9][10]
| Flex slots | — | Utility | `Percussive Maintenance`, `Ribauldequin`, or block cards depending on party needs.[8]

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Ji Poke` + `Ji Thrust` rotation handles 6–8 HP enemies in far lanes with minimal resource use.[2]
- `Windmill Ji` with 6 Ji cards remaining deals 6 damage per target (12 after upgrades), ideal for Act II waves.[3]
- `Sky Ji` punishes stunned bosses with 15+ damage plus stamina gain—perfect when paired with Rogue stuns.[5]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Communicate repositioning so allies don’t waste movement; you can yank bosses into favorable lanes each turn.
- Partner with freeze/stun builds (Mage Snowball, Rogue marks) to trigger the bonus effects on `Sky Ji`/`Ground Ji`.[5]
- During boss thresholds, hold `Fulcrum Ji` for immediate distance control, then follow with your strongest Ji attack once the boss relocates.

## Common Pitfalls
- Removing too many Ji cards; Windmill scaling collapses if you thin the package heavily.
- Forgetting stamina upkeep; without `Stretch`/`Second Wind`, you may take chip damage while repositioning.
- Standing too close—if `Fulcrum Ji` isn’t in hand, block up before trading melee hits.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
