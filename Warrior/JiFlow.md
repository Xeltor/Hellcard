# Warrior Ji Flow Duelist (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Medium (10/15) – positioning takes attention, but once Ji tools arrive you control far lanes all 12 floors.
- **Win condition**: cycle Ji attacks ([`Ji Poke`][card-ji-poke], [`Ji Thrust`][card-ji-thrust], [`Windmill Ji`][card-windmill-ji]) while using [`Fulcrum Ji`][card-fulcrum-ji] and `Dragon Ji` to keep priority enemies at ideal range.
- **Best in**: frontline or mid slot; excels at punishing far enemies and dragging elites into ally kill zones.
- **Key stats**: [`Windmill Ji`][card-windmill-ji] scales with every Ji card in the deck; after a Foreign Coin upgrade you regularly deal 12+ damage cone hits from safety.

## Core Loop
1. Use [`Fulcrum Ji`][card-fulcrum-ji]/`Outreach Ji` to swap dangerous enemies away from the party while banking block on draw.
2. Strike from range with [`Ji Poke`][card-ji-poke], [`Ji Thrust`][card-ji-thrust], and [`Windmill Ji`][card-windmill-ji], then finish stunned/frozen elites with [`Sky Ji`][card-sky-ji] or `Dragon Ji` combos.
3. Reposition each turn so the frontline remains controlled, feeding allies clean targets and keeping your Ji bonuses active.

## Draft Priorities
- **Essentials**: duplicate [`Ji Poke`][card-ji-poke]/[`Ji Thrust`][card-ji-thrust] for cheap far damage; grab [`Fulcrum Ji`][card-fulcrum-ji] early to guarantee distance control.
- **AoE payoffs**: [`Windmill Ji`][card-windmill-ji], [`Ji Sweep`][card-ji-sweep], [`Sky Ji`][card-sky-ji] become priority picks for elite/boss phases.
- **Control tools**: [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe], [`Percussive Maintenance`][card-percussive-maintenance], and `Ribauldequin` add quick stuns when Ji draws lag.
- **Support**: [`Stretch`][card-stretch] or [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] for stamina and block so you can tank hits while repositioning.
- **Removals**: ditch short-range basics (`Sword Slash`, `Slam`) once the Ji package is online to avoid clunky draws.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Fulcrum Ji`][card-fulcrum-ji] (longer push + block on draw) then [`Ji Poke`][card-ji-poke]/[`Ji Thrust`][card-ji-thrust] for higher base damage. Follow with [`Windmill Ji`][card-windmill-ji] scaling if available.
- **Hideout**: remove melee-only starters, Plan either [`Fulcrum Ji`][card-fulcrum-ji] or [`Windmill Ji`][card-windmill-ji], and invest gems in Foreign Coin/Jack artifacts that enhance Ji lines.
- **Vaults**: optional—take them once Ji cores are secured; otherwise focus on reliable upgrades and artifact shops.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Foreign Coin`][card-foreign-coin] (Warrior starter) rebuilds your deck entirely into Ji package—instant synergy if unlocked.
- [`Unripe Banana`][card-unripe-banana] converts leftover mana into block so you can stand near enemies while launching far attacks.
- [`Talking Scabbard`][card-talking-scabbard] replaces `Sword Slash` with `Heavy Sword`, giving better close-range cleanup when needed.
- `Jack` (Tinkerer artifact) isn’t class-specific but fits co-op runs, granting Screws/Cores if you dabble in contraptions via events.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Draw order matters: keep [`Fulcrum Ji`][card-fulcrum-ji] ready before heavy attacks so you can reposition, then strike safely.
- [`Windmill Ji`][card-windmill-ji] adds block on draw proportional to Ji cards remaining—avoid over-thinning your deck so the bonus remains high.
- When enemies are stunned/frozen, [`Sky Ji`][card-sky-ji] and `Ground Ji` reward you with stamina/block; coordinate with allies who can freeze (Mage) or stun (Rogue) for massive bursts.
- Keep an eye on near-range threats; use [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe] or `Kick` from allies to maintain distance if your Ji hand bricks.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Ji Poke`][card-ji-poke] ×2 | 1 / Common | Core poke | Far damage + block on draw keeps you safe.
| [`Fulcrum Ji`][card-fulcrum-ji] | 1 / Common | Reposition | Moves monsters, grants block on draw.
| [`Ji Thrust`][card-ji-thrust] | 1 / Rare | Strong poke | Higher base damage + draw block buffer.
| [`Windmill Ji`][card-windmill-ji] | 2 / Legendary | AoE payoff | Damage scales with Ji count; upgrade when possible.
| [`Sky Ji`][card-sky-ji] or [`Ji Sweep`][card-ji-sweep] | 2 / Legendary | Elite/boss finisher | Huge damage vs stunned/frozen foes.
| [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe] | 1 / Common | Control | Pulls elites near allies for focused fire.
| [`Stretch`][card-stretch] / [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] | 1 / Common/Rare | Sustain | Keeps stamina/mana flowing for repeated Ji casts.
| Flex slots | — | Utility | [`Percussive Maintenance`][card-percussive-maintenance], `Ribauldequin`, or block cards depending on party needs.

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Ji Poke`][card-ji-poke] + [`Ji Thrust`][card-ji-thrust] rotation handles 6–8 HP enemies in far lanes with minimal resource use.
- [`Windmill Ji`][card-windmill-ji] with 6 Ji cards remaining deals 6 damage per target (12 after upgrades), ideal for Act II waves.
- [`Sky Ji`][card-sky-ji] punishes stunned bosses with 15+ damage plus stamina gain—perfect when paired with Rogue stuns.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Communicate repositioning so allies don’t waste movement; you can yank bosses into favorable lanes each turn.
- Partner with freeze/stun builds (Mage Snowball, Rogue marks) to trigger the bonus effects on [`Sky Ji`][card-sky-ji]/`Ground Ji`.
- During boss thresholds, hold [`Fulcrum Ji`][card-fulcrum-ji] for immediate distance control, then follow with your strongest Ji attack once the boss relocates.

## Common Pitfalls
- Removing too many Ji cards; Windmill scaling collapses if you thin the package heavily.
- Forgetting stamina upkeep; without [`Stretch`][card-stretch]/[`Second Wind`][card-second-wind], you may take chip damage while repositioning.
- Standing too close—if [`Fulcrum Ji`][card-fulcrum-ji] isn’t in hand, block up before trading melee hits.
