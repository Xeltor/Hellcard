# Warrior Banner Captain (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: flood the party with block and draw ([`Heroism`][card-heroism], [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie], [`Tactics`][card-tactics]), then leverage mark/control tools ([`Single Out`][card-single-out], [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe]) so allies delete focused targets.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (8/15) – defensive sequencing is light, but keeping the shield engine online for all 12 floors requires consistent upgrades.
- **Best in**: frontline co-op support; you hold aggro, clear chip damage, and keep allies ready.
- **Key stats**: upgraded [`Heroism`][card-heroism] grants 6 block to every hero—combo with [`Single Out`][card-single-out] and ally burst to erase elite threats safely.

## Core Loop
1. Cast block cards ([`Safeguard`][card-safeguard], [`Heroism`][card-heroism], `Cover` equivalents) to keep the team topped off.
2. Use [`Single Out`][card-single-out]/[`Akanbe`][card-akanbe] to mark or reposition enemies, making ally bursts more efficient.
3. Refill hands with [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie]/[`Tactics`][card-tactics] and repeat; mix in [`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield] or `Battering Ram` if you need extra damage.

## Draft Priorities
- **Team block**: [`Heroism`][card-heroism], [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard], `Cover`, `Ploughshares` – simple, consistent protection.
- **Card flow**: [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie], [`Tactics`][card-tactics], [`Stretch`][card-stretch] keep you and allies drawing.
- **Focus tools**: [`Single Out`][card-single-out], [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe], [`Percussive Maintenance`][card-percussive-maintenance] control enemy placement and block.
- **Damage options**: [`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield], [`Judgemental Scowl`][card-judgemental-scowl], `Battering Ram` convert block into offense without diluting the support plan.
- **Removals**: ditch HP-sacrificing attacks; this build succeeds by staying healthy and enabling allies.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Heroism`][card-heroism] then [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard]/`Ploughshares` for bigger block numbers.
- **Hideout**: target removals, Plan [`Heroism`][card-heroism], and gift gems until you can pick up supportive artifacts ([`Tankard`][card-tankard], [`Talking Scabbard`][card-talking-scabbard]).
- **Vaults**: optional—take them when you want more relics; your core loop runs on commons.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Tankard`][card-tankard] – adds [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie] and `Fool's Guard`, reinforcing draw and block.
- [`Talking Scabbard`][card-talking-scabbard] – upgrades `Sword Slash` to `Heavy Sword`, giving you reliable cleanup without compromising defense.
- [`Beetroot`][card-beetroot] – extra HP ensures you survive stray hits while shielding others.
- [`Unripe Banana`][card-unripe-banana] – converts leftover mana into block, pairing nicely with defensive turns.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Lead with [`Single Out`][card-single-out] before allies attack; the +damage applies to every hit that turn.
- Keep [`Heroism`][card-heroism] ready for elite turns; doubling block on the whole party keeps them free to burn resources offensively.
- Don’t forget your own damage—[`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield] after building block ensures fights finish before enemies reset.
- In co-op, communicate when you’ll cast [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie] so allies plan resource dumps first.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Heroism`][card-heroism] ×2 | 2 / Common | Team block | Upgrade for +6 block to all heroes.
| [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard] | 1 / Common | Personal block | Cheap block to keep yourself safe.
| `Ploughshares` | 0 / Common | Free block | Play whenever hand is light on attacks.
| [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie] | 1 / Common | Team draw | Essential in co-op; keeps hands full.
| [`Tactics`][card-tactics] | 1 / Common | Draw + block | Ensures you dig back to Heroism quickly.
| [`Single Out`][card-single-out] | 1 / Common | Mark target | Focus damage for the whole team.
| [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe] | 1 / Common | Reposition | Pulls elites for allies to burst.
| [`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield] | 1 / Common | Block-to-damage | Clears lanes after defensive setup.
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Percussive Maintenance`][card-percussive-maintenance], [`Judgemental Scowl`][card-judgemental-scowl], or ally-support cards depending on drops. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Heroism`][card-heroism] + `Boome rang Shield` with 18 block deals 18 damage; enough to eliminate most Act II enemies in one swing.
- [`Single Out`][card-single-out] boosts every ally strike by +1, turning multi-hit attacks into elite killers.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Lead the defensive rotation; call out when Heroism is ready so allies plan aggressive turns.
- Mark bosses with [`Single Out`][card-single-out] before ally burst windows; the +damage stacks with Rogue mark builds.
- Keep [`Percussive Maintenance`][card-percussive-maintenance] or [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe] handy for boss thresholds; stunning or repositioning them buys time to restack block.

## Common Pitfalls
- Sitting on [`Heroism`][card-heroism]; use it proactively so allies can spend mana freely.
- Over-removing attacks—keep at least two finishers so you can actually end fights.
- Ignoring your own HP; even support warriors need to manage chip damage between floors.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
