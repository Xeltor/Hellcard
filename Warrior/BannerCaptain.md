# Warrior Banner Captain (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: flood the party with block and draw (`Heroism`, `Camaraderie`, `Tactics`), then leverage mark/control tools (`Single Out`, `Akanbe`) so allies delete focused targets.[1][2][3]
- **Difficulty**: Medium (8/15) – defensive sequencing is light, but keeping the shield engine online for all 12 floors requires consistent upgrades.
- **Best in**: frontline co-op support; you hold aggro, clear chip damage, and keep allies ready.
- **Key stats**: upgraded `Heroism` grants 6 block to every hero—combo with `Single Out` and ally burst to erase elite threats safely.

## Core Loop
1. Cast block cards (`Safeguard`, `Heroism`, `Cover` equivalents) to keep the team topped off.[1][2]
2. Use `Single Out`/`Akanbe` to mark or reposition enemies, making ally bursts more efficient.[3][4]
3. Refill hands with `Camaraderie`/`Tactics` and repeat; mix in `Boomerang Shield` or `Battering Ram` if you need extra damage.[2][5]

## Draft Priorities
- **Team block**: `Heroism`, `Safeguard`, `Cover`, `Ploughshares` – simple, consistent protection.[1][2][6]
- **Card flow**: `Camaraderie`, `Tactics`, `Stretch` keep you and allies drawing.[2][7][8]
- **Focus tools**: `Single Out`, `Akanbe`, `Percussive Maintenance` control enemy placement and block.[3][4][9]
- **Damage options**: `Boomerang Shield`, `Judgemental Scowl`, `Battering Ram` convert block into offense without diluting the support plan.[5][10]
- **Removals**: ditch HP-sacrificing attacks; this build succeeds by staying healthy and enabling allies.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Heroism` then `Safeguard`/`Ploughshares` for bigger block numbers.[1][6]
- **Hideout**: target removals, Plan `Heroism`, and gift gems until you can pick up supportive artifacts (`Tankard`, `Talking Scabbard`).[11]
- **Vaults**: optional—take them when you want more relics; your core loop runs on commons.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Tankard` – adds `Camaraderie` and `Fool's Guard`, reinforcing draw and block.[12]
- `Talking Scabbard` – upgrades `Sword Slash` to `Heavy Sword`, giving you reliable cleanup without compromising defense.[13]
- `Beetroot` – extra HP ensures you survive stray hits while shielding others.[14]
- `Unripe Banana` – converts leftover mana into block, pairing nicely with defensive turns.[15]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Lead with `Single Out` before allies attack; the +damage applies to every hit that turn.[3]
- Keep `Heroism` ready for elite turns; doubling block on the whole party keeps them free to burn resources offensively.[1]
- Don’t forget your own damage—`Boomerang Shield` after building block ensures fights finish before enemies reset.
- In co-op, communicate when you’ll cast `Camaraderie` so allies plan resource dumps first.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Heroism` ×2 | 2 / Common | Team block | Upgrade for +6 block to all heroes.[1]
| `Safeguard` | 1 / Common | Personal block | Cheap block to keep yourself safe.[6]
| `Ploughshares` | 0 / Common | Free block | Play whenever hand is light on attacks.[6]
| `Camaraderie` | 1 / Common | Team draw | Essential in co-op; keeps hands full.[2]
| `Tactics` | 1 / Common | Draw + block | Ensures you dig back to Heroism quickly.[7]
| `Single Out` | 1 / Common | Mark target | Focus damage for the whole team.[3]
| `Akanbe` | 1 / Common | Reposition | Pulls elites for allies to burst.[4]
| `Boomerang Shield` | 1 / Common | Block-to-damage | Clears lanes after defensive setup.[5]
| Flex slot | — | Utility | `Percussive Maintenance`, `Judgemental Scowl`, or ally-support cards depending on drops.[9][10] |

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Heroism` + `Boome rang Shield` with 18 block deals 18 damage; enough to eliminate most Act II enemies in one swing.[1][5]
- `Single Out` boosts every ally strike by +1, turning multi-hit attacks into elite killers.[3]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Lead the defensive rotation; call out when Heroism is ready so allies plan aggressive turns.
- Mark bosses with `Single Out` before ally burst windows; the +damage stacks with Rogue mark builds.
- Keep `Percussive Maintenance` or `Akanbe` handy for boss thresholds; stunning or repositioning them buys time to restack block.

## Common Pitfalls
- Sitting on `Heroism`; use it proactively so allies can spend mana freely.
- Over-removing attacks—keep at least two finishers so you can actually end fights.
- Ignoring your own HP; even support warriors need to manage chip damage between floors.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
