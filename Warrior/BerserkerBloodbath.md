# Warrior Berserker Bloodbath (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: dip below 60% HP to supercharge attacks like `Seeping Wound`, `Sacrificial Lunge`, and `Necrotize`, then finish with `Deathblow` while `Second Wind` patches your stamina.[1][2][3]
- **Difficulty**: High (13/15) – thriving for 12 floors means walking a razor’s edge with HP thresholds and timing your heals perfectly.
- **Best in**: solo frontline or aggressive co-op compositions that rely on one player deleting elites fast.
- **Key stats**: `Necrotize` hits for half your missing HP; with 30 missing, it slams for 15 damage while `Second Wind` refills stamina/mana afterwards.[3][4]

## Core Loop
1. Use `Sacrificial Lunge`/`Seeping Wound` to intentionally lose block/HP while chunking enemies.[2][5]
2. Follow with massive finishers (`Necrotize`, `Tit for Tat`, `Deathblow`) once enemies fall into kill range.[3][6]
3. Recover with `Second Wind`, `Leeches`, or ally support before the next fight so you can repeat without dying.[1][7]

## Draft Priorities
- **HP-scaling attacks**: `Seeping Wound`, `Necrotize`, `Tit for Tat`, `All Out Strike` – these multiply damage the lower you are.[2][3][6][8]
- **Finishers**: `Deathblow` cleans up wounded elites; `Mighty Blow` or `Groundbreaker` handle crowds.[6][9]
- **Stamina recovery**: `Second Wind`, `Stretch`, `Weakest Link` keep stamina/mana available despite Strain cards.[1][10]
- **Safety nets**: `Leeches`, `Cover`, `Heroism` prevent accidental deaths while you run hot HP totals.[7][11][12]
- **Removals**: cut block-focused starters (except key support) so you cycle into big hits faster.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Necrotize` then `Seeping Wound`; follow with `Second Wind` to increase draw/mana refunds.[3][2][1]
- **Hideout**: remove defensive filler, Plan `Seeping Wound`, and aim for artifacts that reward low HP such as `Red Beads`.[13]
- **Vaults**: take them if you need relics; otherwise focus on Armory/Hideout to keep damage curve ahead of enemy HP.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Red Beads` – heals allies whenever you hurt yourself, counteracting the HP drain.[13]
- `Finger Guillotine` – +1 max HP after every fight offsets constant self damage.[14]
- `Beetroot` – large HP boost so you can safely ride low percentages.[11]
- `Talking Scabbard` – better close-range follow-up when you need to finish near foes after Necrotize.[15]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Start fights by dipping below thresholds with `Sacrificial Lunge`/`Seeping Wound`, then pop `Second Wind` once the kill lands.[2][1]
- Use `Tit for Tat`/`Necrotize` only when you know you’ll survive the counterattack; keep `Heroism` ready for emergencies.[3][12]
- `Deathblow` finishes 10 HP enemies; use it to avoid wasting huge overkill attacks.[6]
- Communicate with allies so they know when you’ll be low—heals like `Camaraderie` or `Leeches` from Bruja partners keep you alive.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Second Wind` ×2 | 1 / Rare | Recovery | Refills stamina/mana after risky strikes.[1]
| `Seeping Wound` | 1 / Rare | HP-scaling strike | Upgrade to hit for +9 at low HP.[2]
| `Necrotize` | 1 / Common | Missing-HP nuke | Strain; line up big hits when low.[3]
| `Tit for Tat` | 1 / Rare | HP burst | Finisher when below 70% HP.[6]
| `Sacrificial Lunge` | 1 / Common | Self-chip opener | Drops block to enable later hits.[5]
| `Deathblow` | 2 / Rare | Execute | Cleans up wounded elites safely.[6]
| `Stretch` / `Weakest Link` | 1 / Common/Rare | Stamina | Keeps you facing elites even after bursts.[10]
| `Leeches` | 0 / Common (dropped) | Sustain | Grab from Bruja allies or artifacts to heal after fights.[7]
| Flex slot | — | Utility | `Heroism`, `Groundbreaker`, or ally support depending on needs.[12][9] |

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Necrotize` at 30 missing HP deals 15 damage; pair with `Deathblow` to erase 25+ HP elites in one turn.[3][6]
- `Seeping Wound` + `Tit for Tat` from 50% HP deals 20+ combined damage before stamina recovery.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Signal when you’re diving low; allies can contribute block or healing to keep you alive between thresholds.
- Save `Second Wind` for boss thresholds so you can burst twice in a row without dying.[1]
- Against multi-hit bosses, open with `Heroism` for block before deliberately dropping HP for the next cycle.[12]

## Common Pitfalls
- Staying low between fights; always heal via `Leeches`/Camp nodes before the next floor.
- Forgetting Strain on `Necrotize`; plan turns so you don’t strand yourself without mana.
- Removing too many defensive tools; you still need minimal block to survive enemy turns.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
