# Warrior Berserker Bloodbath (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: dip below 60% HP to supercharge attacks like [`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound], [`Sacrificial Lunge`][card-sacrificial-lunge], and [`Necrotize`][card-necrotize], then finish with [`Deathblow`][card-deathblow] while [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] patches your stamina.
- **Difficulty**: High (13/15) – thriving for 12 floors means walking a razor’s edge with HP thresholds and timing your heals perfectly.
- **Best in**: solo frontline or aggressive co-op compositions that rely on one player deleting elites fast.
- **Key stats**: [`Necrotize`][card-necrotize] hits for half your missing HP; with 30 missing, it slams for 15 damage while [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] refills stamina/mana afterwards.

## Core Loop
1. Use [`Sacrificial Lunge`][card-sacrificial-lunge]/[`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound] to intentionally lose block/HP while chunking enemies.
2. Follow with massive finishers ([`Necrotize`][card-necrotize], [`Tit for Tat`][card-tit-for-tat], [`Deathblow`][card-deathblow]) once enemies fall into kill range.
3. Recover with [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind], [`Leeches`][card-leeches], or ally support before the next fight so you can repeat without dying.

## Draft Priorities
- **HP-scaling attacks**: [`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound], [`Necrotize`][card-necrotize], [`Tit for Tat`][card-tit-for-tat], [`All Out Strike`][card-all-out-strike] – these multiply damage the lower you are.
- **Finishers**: [`Deathblow`][card-deathblow] cleans up wounded elites; `Mighty Blow` or [`Groundbreaker`][card-groundbreaker] handle crowds.
- **Stamina recovery**: [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind], `Stretch`, [`Weakest Link`][card-weakest-link] keep stamina/mana available despite Strain cards.
- **Safety nets**: [`Leeches`][card-leeches], `Cover`, [`Heroism`][card-heroism] prevent accidental deaths while you run hot HP totals.
- **Removals**: cut block-focused starters (except key support) so you cycle into big hits faster.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Necrotize`][card-necrotize] then [`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound]; follow with [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] to increase draw/mana refunds.
- **Hideout**: remove defensive filler, Plan [`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound], and aim for artifacts that reward low HP such as [`Red Beads`][card-red-beads].
- **Vaults**: take them if you need relics; otherwise focus on Armory/Hideout to keep damage curve ahead of enemy HP.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Red Beads`][card-red-beads] – heals allies whenever you hurt yourself, counteracting the HP drain.
- [`Finger Guillotine`][card-finger-guillotine] – +1 max HP after every fight offsets constant self damage.
- [`Beetroot`][card-beetroot] – large HP boost so you can safely ride low percentages.
- [`Talking Scabbard`][card-talking-scabbard] – better close-range follow-up when you need to finish near foes after Necrotize.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Start fights by dipping below thresholds with [`Sacrificial Lunge`][card-sacrificial-lunge]/[`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound], then pop [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] once the kill lands.
- Use [`Tit for Tat`][card-tit-for-tat]/[`Necrotize`][card-necrotize] only when you know you’ll survive the counterattack; keep [`Heroism`][card-heroism] ready for emergencies.
- [`Deathblow`][card-deathblow] finishes 10 HP enemies; use it to avoid wasting huge overkill attacks.
- Communicate with allies so they know when you’ll be low—heals like `Camaraderie` or [`Leeches`][card-leeches] from Bruja partners keep you alive.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] ×2 | 1 / Rare | Recovery | Refills stamina/mana after risky strikes.
| [`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound] | 1 / Rare | HP-scaling strike | Upgrade to hit for +9 at low HP.
| [`Necrotize`][card-necrotize] | 1 / Common | Missing-HP nuke | Strain; line up big hits when low.
| [`Tit for Tat`][card-tit-for-tat] | 1 / Rare | HP burst | Finisher when below 70% HP.
| [`Sacrificial Lunge`][card-sacrificial-lunge] | 1 / Common | Self-chip opener | Drops block to enable later hits.
| [`Deathblow`][card-deathblow] | 2 / Rare | Execute | Cleans up wounded elites safely.
| `Stretch` / [`Weakest Link`][card-weakest-link] | 1 / Common/Rare | Stamina | Keeps you facing elites even after bursts.
| [`Leeches`][card-leeches] | 0 / Common (dropped) | Sustain | Grab from Bruja allies or artifacts to heal after fights.
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Heroism`][card-heroism], [`Groundbreaker`][card-groundbreaker], or ally support depending on needs. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Necrotize`][card-necrotize] at 30 missing HP deals 15 damage; pair with [`Deathblow`][card-deathblow] to erase 25+ HP elites in one turn.
- [`Seeping Wound`][card-seeping-wound] + [`Tit for Tat`][card-tit-for-tat] from 50% HP deals 20+ combined damage before stamina recovery.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Signal when you’re diving low; allies can contribute block or healing to keep you alive between thresholds.
- Save [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] for boss thresholds so you can burst twice in a row without dying.
- Against multi-hit bosses, open with [`Heroism`][card-heroism] for block before deliberately dropping HP for the next cycle.

## Common Pitfalls
- Staying low between fights; always heal via [`Leeches`][card-leeches]/Camp nodes before the next floor.
- Forgetting Strain on [`Necrotize`][card-necrotize]; plan turns so you don’t strand yourself without mana.
- Removing too many defensive tools; you still need minimal block to survive enemy turns.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
