# Warrior Iron Choir Warlord (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: rotate team shouts ([`Inspire`][card-inspire], [`Team Effort`][card-team-effort], [`One For All`][card-one-for-all]) to buff allies while maintaining taunt and block, letting them shred waves safely.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (9/15) – requires tracking ally turns, but individual cards are easy to pilot.
- **Best in**: co-op frontline; you orchestrate team damage and protection.
- **Key stats**: [`Team Effort`][card-team-effort] grants +2 damage per hero and 4 block, while [`Inspire`][card-inspire] hands every ally a free attack.

## Core Loop
1. Establish aggro with [`Taunt`][card-taunt], [`Defiant Roar`][card-defiant-roar], or [`Shield Block`][card-shield-block], keeping enemies focused on you.
2. Cast shouts ([`Inspire`][card-inspire], [`Team Effort`][card-team-effort], [`One For All`][card-one-for-all]) to boost ally attacks and refresh their resources.
3. Follow with [`Heroism`][card-heroism] or [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard] to soak incoming damage while allies capitalize on buffs.

## Draft Priorities
- **Shout package**: [`Inspire`][card-inspire], [`Team Effort`][card-team-effort], [`One For All`][card-one-for-all], [`Insult`][card-insult] (for taunt + buff) are mandatory picks.
- **Defense**: [`Taunt`][card-taunt], [`Shield Block`][card-shield-block], [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard], [`Ploughshares`][card-ploughshares] ensure you survive waves.
- **Support tools**: [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie] for draw, [`Judgemental Scowl`][card-judgemental-scowl] to strip block so allies deal full damage.
- **Removals**: drop heavy attacks; you only need a small finisher package for emergencies.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Team Effort`][card-team-effort], then [`Inspire`][card-inspire] so buffs scale; [`Heroism`][card-heroism] third for more party block.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Team Effort`][card-team-effort], remove redundant swords, and invest gems into artifacts that add support cards ([`Tankard`][card-tankard], [`Chocolate Box`][card-chocolate-box]).
- **Vaults**: good targets—legendary shouts or relics can supercharge the support loop.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Tankard`][card-tankard] – brings [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie] and `Fool's Guard`, perfect for keeping everyone fueled.
- [`Chocolate Box`][card-chocolate-box] – offers situational answers like `Finesse` or `Keeping Distance` for allies.
- [`Unripe Banana`][card-unripe-banana] – free block helps survive while you spam shouts.
- [`Beetroot`][card-beetroot] – extra HP allows more aggressive taunting.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Taunt before shouting; buffs mean nothing if enemies ignore you and hit allies.
- [`Team Effort`][card-team-effort] before ally burst turns; it adds block plus damage so they can stand in melee.
- Use [`One For All`][card-one-for-all] when the team hand is clogged—it recycles cards and adds 3 block each.
- Co-op: communicate buff order so allies plan their turns around your shouts.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Team Effort`][card-team-effort] ×2 | 1 / Rare | Primary buff | Upgrade for +2 damage per hero. |
| [`Inspire`][card-inspire] | 1 / Rare | Free attacks | Allies love the 0-cost attack draw. |
| [`One For All`][card-one-for-all] | 2 / Rare | Hand reset | Best in 3-player co-op. |
| [`Taunt`][card-taunt] | 1 / Common | Aggro control | Keeps enemies focused on you. |
| [`Defiant Roar`][card-defiant-roar] | 1 / Common | Block + taunt | Backup aggro when Taunt hides. |
| [`Shield Block`][card-shield-block] | 1 / Starter | Team block | Protect squishy casters. |
| [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard] | 1 / Common | Block | Reliable shield you can cast every turn. |
| [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie] | 1 / Common | Draw | Keeps your hand and allies refreshed. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Judgemental Scowl`][card-judgemental-scowl], [`Heroism`][card-heroism], or artifact cards depending on party.

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Team Effort`][card-team-effort] + ally bursts often convert to 20+ extra team damage per turn in co-op.
- [`Judgemental Scowl`][card-judgemental-scowl] sets up big spell turns by stripping armor instantly.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Boss phases with adds: taunt the boss, shout, then let teammates sweep adds while you hold aggro.
- [`Heroism`][card-heroism] should be saved for multi-hit boss mechanics to prevent chip deaths.
- Share draw from [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie] when teammates dig for key cards.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to refresh taunt; once enemies slip past you, allies get hammered.
- Overdrafting damage—your job is buffs and block.
- Not upgrading [`Team Effort`][card-team-effort]; unupgraded version falls off Act II.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
