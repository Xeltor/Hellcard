# Warrior Safeguard Vanguard (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Low (5/15) – straightforward block-first rotation with commons that hold up across the 12-floor campaign.
- **Win condition**: stack block with [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard], [`Ploughshares`][card-ploughshares], and [`Heroism`][card-heroism], then convert it to damage via [`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield] and safe melee pokes.
- **Best in**: frontline solo or co-op; excels at keeping the team alive while chip damage finishes waves.
- **Key stats**: a 20+ block [`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield] hit wipes near lanes; double-casting [`Heroism`][card-heroism] covers the whole party for elite turns.

## Core Loop
1. Open turns with block gain ([`Safeguard`][card-safeguard], [`Ploughshares`][card-ploughshares], [`Shield Block`][card-shield-block]) to protect yourself and set up later damage.
2. Apply [`Judgemental Scowl`][card-judgemental-scowl] on shielded enemies, then fire [`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield] to convert your block into damage across the lane.
3. Use [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie]/[`Tactics`][card-tactics] for draw while maintaining block; finish survivors with `Sword Slash`/`Short Sword`.

## Draft Priorities
- **Block core**: [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard], [`Ploughshares`][card-ploughshares], [`Shield Block`][card-shield-block], [`Heroism`][card-heroism] (team block), [`Tactics`][card-tactics] for block + draw.
- **Damage from block**: [`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield] and [`Judgemental Scowl`][card-judgemental-scowl] so you punch through enemy armor easily.
- **Utility**: [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe] for positioning, [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie] for draw and co-op support.
- **Removals**: cut high-cost strains (`Slam`, `Fury`) quickly so your deck keeps cycling cheap defense.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield] first for higher damage scaling, then [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard]/[`Ploughshares`][card-ploughshares] to increase block values.
- **Hideout**: remove `Slam`/`Sacrificial Lunge`, use **Plan** to pin [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard], and gift gems if the Warrior still needs an artifact like [`Talking Scabbard`][card-talking-scabbard] or [`Tankard`][card-tankard].
- **Vaults**: optional; this build survives without rare relics, so only visit when HP and block are stable.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Talking Scabbard`][card-talking-scabbard] – upgrades `Sword Slash` into `Heavy Sword` for better single-target cleanup.
- [`Tankard`][card-tankard] – adds [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie] and `Fool's Guard`, bolstering draw + block options.
- [`Beetroot`][card-beetroot] – +7 max HP gives more room to soak hits while block ramps.
- [`Unripe Banana`][card-unripe-banana] – rewards ending turns with extra mana by granting block, perfect for this defensive loop.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Always play block cards before [`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield]; its damage equals your current block, so the order is everything.
- Keep at least one block card for enemy phases; the build wins by never letting HP drop below safe thresholds.
- Use [`Heroism`][card-heroism] sparingly—its 2-cost tag is heavy, but covering the whole team before elite swings can swing a fight.
- When [`Judgemental Scowl`][card-judgemental-scowl] breaks enemy block, follow immediately with physical hits to avoid giving them time to rebuild armor.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard] ×2 | 1 / Common | Primary block | Cheap 4 block every turn; upgrade to 6. |
| [`Ploughshares`][card-ploughshares] | 0 / Common | Free block | Play whenever hand lacks attacks; upgrade for 6 block. |
| [`Shield Block`][card-shield-block] | 1 / Starter | Team support | Target allies in co-op to keep them healthy. |
| [`Heroism`][card-heroism] | 2 / Common | AOE block | Great for elite waves; use when multiple allies exposed. |
| [`Tactics`][card-tactics] | 1 / Common | Draw + block | Keeps hand full while adding 2 block. |
| [`Camaraderie`][card-camaraderie] | 1 / Common | Team draw | Refreshes hands, especially useful in co-op. |
| [`Judgemental Scowl`][card-judgemental-scowl] | 1 / Common | Block breaker | Strips enemy armor and grants 2 block. |
| [`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield] | 1 / Common | Damage payoff | Converts accumulated block to cone damage. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe] (position), `Charge` (burst), or artifact-added cards depending on drops. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- 12 block → [`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield] deals 12 to the front line; with upgraded block cards, 20+ damage is common by Act II.
- [`Judgemental Scowl`][card-judgemental-scowl] + `Short Sword` deletes shielded enemies without burning block resources.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Shield allies with [`Heroism`][card-heroism]/[`Shield Block`][card-shield-block] while they focus on damage; your [`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield] softens lanes for them.
- Keep [`Akanbe`][card-akanbe] to pull bosses inward so your cone attacks and ally AOEs connect.
- Against multi-hit bosses, stack Ploughshares + Safeguard, then return fire with high-block Boomerang casts.

## Common Pitfalls
- Playing [`Boomerang Shield`][card-boomerang-shield] before stacking block—always delay damage until you’re armored up.
- Sitting on [`Heroism`][card-heroism] too long; use it proactively to avoid chip damage that breaks the loop.
- Neglecting removals; the cleaner the deck, the more often you draw block-to-damage combos.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
