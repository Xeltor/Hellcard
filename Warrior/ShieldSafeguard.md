# Warrior Safeguard Vanguard (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Low (5/15) – straightforward block-first rotation with commons that hold up across the 12-floor campaign.
- **Win condition**: stack block with `Safeguard`, `Ploughshares`, and `Heroism`, then convert it to damage via `Boomerang Shield` and safe melee pokes.[1][2][3][4]
- **Best in**: frontline solo or co-op; excels at keeping the team alive while chip damage finishes waves.
- **Key stats**: a 20+ block `Boomerang Shield` hit wipes near lanes; double-casting `Heroism` covers the whole party for elite turns.[2][3]

## Core Loop
1. Open turns with block gain (`Safeguard`, `Ploughshares`, `Shield Block`) to protect yourself and set up later damage.[1][4][5]
2. Apply `Judgemental Scowl` on shielded enemies, then fire `Boomerang Shield` to convert your block into damage across the lane.[2][6]
3. Use `Camaraderie`/`Tactics` for draw while maintaining block; finish survivors with `Sword Slash`/`Short Sword`.[3][7][8]

## Draft Priorities
- **Block core**: `Safeguard`, `Ploughshares`, `Shield Block`, `Heroism` (team block), `Tactics` for block + draw.[1][3][5][8]
- **Damage from block**: `Boomerang Shield` and `Judgemental Scowl` so you punch through enemy armor easily.[2][6]
- **Utility**: `Akanbe` for positioning, `Camaraderie` for draw and co-op support.[7][9]
- **Removals**: cut high-cost strains (`Slam`, `Fury`) quickly so your deck keeps cycling cheap defense.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Boomerang Shield` first for higher damage scaling, then `Safeguard`/`Ploughshares` to increase block values.[1][2]
- **Hideout**: remove `Slam`/`Sacrificial Lunge`, use **Plan** to pin `Safeguard`, and gift gems if the Warrior still needs an artifact like `Talking Scabbard` or `Tankard`.[10]
- **Vaults**: optional; this build survives without rare relics, so only visit when HP and block are stable.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Talking Scabbard` – upgrades `Sword Slash` into `Heavy Sword` for better single-target cleanup.[11]
- `Tankard` – adds `Camaraderie` and `Fool's Guard`, bolstering draw + block options.[12]
- `Beetroot` – +7 max HP gives more room to soak hits while block ramps.[13]
- `Unripe Banana` – rewards ending turns with extra mana by granting block, perfect for this defensive loop.[14]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Always play block cards before `Boomerang Shield`; its damage equals your current block, so the order is everything.[2]
- Keep at least one block card for enemy phases; the build wins by never letting HP drop below safe thresholds.
- Use `Heroism` sparingly—its 2-cost tag is heavy, but covering the whole team before elite swings can swing a fight.[3]
- When `Judgemental Scowl` breaks enemy block, follow immediately with physical hits to avoid giving them time to rebuild armor.[6]

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Safeguard` ×2 | 1 / Common | Primary block | Cheap 4 block every turn; upgrade to 6.[1] |
| `Ploughshares` | 0 / Common | Free block | Play whenever hand lacks attacks; upgrade for 6 block.[5] |
| `Shield Block` | 1 / Starter | Team support | Target allies in co-op to keep them healthy.[4] |
| `Heroism` | 2 / Common | AOE block | Great for elite waves; use when multiple allies exposed.[3] |
| `Tactics` | 1 / Common | Draw + block | Keeps hand full while adding 2 block.[8] |
| `Camaraderie` | 1 / Common | Team draw | Refreshes hands, especially useful in co-op.[7] |
| `Judgemental Scowl` | 1 / Common | Block breaker | Strips enemy armor and grants 2 block.[6] |
| `Boomerang Shield` | 1 / Common | Damage payoff | Converts accumulated block to cone damage.[2] |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | `Akanbe` (position), `Charge` (burst), or artifact-added cards depending on drops.[9] |

## Damage Benchmarks
- 12 block → `Boomerang Shield` deals 12 to the front line; with upgraded block cards, 20+ damage is common by Act II.[2]
- `Judgemental Scowl` + `Short Sword` deletes shielded enemies without burning block resources.[6]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Shield allies with `Heroism`/`Shield Block` while they focus on damage; your `Boomerang Shield` softens lanes for them.
- Keep `Akanbe` to pull bosses inward so your cone attacks and ally AOEs connect.[9]
- Against multi-hit bosses, stack Ploughshares + Safeguard, then return fire with high-block Boomerang casts.

## Common Pitfalls
- Playing `Boomerang Shield` before stacking block—always delay damage until you’re armored up.
- Sitting on `Heroism` too long; use it proactively to avoid chip damage that breaks the loop.
- Neglecting removals; the cleaner the deck, the more often you draw block-to-damage combos.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
