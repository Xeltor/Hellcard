# Warrior Juggernaut Momentum (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: chain [`Momentum`][card-momentum], [`Charge`][card-charge], and [`Reckless Charge`][card-reckless-charge] to stack damage while [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] and [`Cardio`][card-cardio] refuel stamina for another pass.
- **Difficulty**: High (12/15) – sequencing is unforgiving and positioning mistakes are lethal.
- **Best in**: solo frontline; in co-op you need allies who can cover backline while you dash through lanes.
- **Key stats**: upgraded [`Momentum`][card-momentum] gives +2 damage per move and 2 block, letting you sprint while staying alive.

## Core Loop
1. Build stamina and block using [`Cardio`][card-cardio], [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind], and [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard] before charging in.
2. Chain [`Charge`][card-charge] → [`Reckless Charge`][card-reckless-charge] → [`Momentum`][card-momentum] for escalating damage and lane traversal.
3. Finish with [`Unleash`][card-unleash] or `Mighty Blow` once stamina is nearly empty, then reset with [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] or [`Cardio`][card-cardio].

## Draft Priorities
- **Charge suite**: [`Momentum`][card-momentum], [`Charge`][card-charge], [`Reckless Charge`][card-reckless-charge], and [`Breakthrough`][card-breakthrough]; upgrade [`Momentum`][card-momentum] first.
- **Stamina refuels**: [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind], [`Cardio`][card-cardio], [`Thrill`][card-thrill] ensure you keep dashing.
- **Defense**: [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard], [`Defiant Roar`][card-defiant-roar], `Shield Block` cover turns when charges miss.
- **Removals**: cut stationary swings—if a card doesn’t move you, reconsider it.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: [`Momentum`][card-momentum] → [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] → [`Reckless Charge`][card-reckless-charge]; damage depends on upgrades.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Momentum`][card-momentum], remove slow attacks, and buy stamina artifacts ([`Unagi`][card-unagi], [`Veteran Pin`][card-veteran-pin]).
- **Vaults**: attempt once you secure both refuels; legendary movement cards supercharge the deck.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Unagi`][card-unagi] – guarantees enough starting stamina to open with double charge turns.
- [`Veteran Pin`][card-veteran-pin] – refunds stamina when your hand empties, perfect post-dash.
- [`Foreign Coin`][card-foreign-coin] – extra gems fund more upgrades for charge cards.
- [`Chocolate Box`][card-chocolate-box] – adds utility cards for defense on low-stamina turns.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Always leave stamina for [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind]; ending empty risks standing in danger zones.
- Use [`Momentum`][card-momentum] mid-chain so its block protects you before the next dash lands.
- Co-op: announce your path—charges can push enemies into allies if they’re not ready.
- Positioning is everything; if a lane is blocked, use [`Breakthrough`][card-breakthrough] to slam through instead of skipping your turn.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Momentum`][card-momentum] ×2 | 1 / Rare | Damage + block | Upgrade for bigger hits per move. |
| [`Charge`][card-charge] ×2 | 1 / Common | Core mover | Cheap gap closer and combo starter. |
| [`Reckless Charge`][card-reckless-charge] | 1 / Rare | High damage | Pair with block to stay alive. |
| [`Breakthrough`][card-breakthrough] | 2 / Rare | Lane clear | Pushes through blockers without stopping. |
| [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] | 0 / Rare | Stamina refill | Mandatory for double-charge turns. |
| [`Cardio`][card-cardio] | 0 / Rare | Free block/stamina | Keeps the engine looping. |
| [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard] | 1 / Common | Block | Cover whiff turns. |
| [`Defiant Roar`][card-defiant-roar] | 1 / Common | Block + taunt | Pulls aggro back to you. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Unleash`][card-unleash], `Mighty Blow`, or artifact cards to finish elites. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Cardio`][card-cardio] → [`Charge`][card-charge] → [`Momentum`][card-momentum] → [`Reckless Charge`][card-reckless-charge] deals 20+ while granting 6 block mid-chain.
- [`Breakthrough`][card-breakthrough] enders hit 15+ with momentum stacks on elite packs.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Coordinate dashes so you don’t shove elites into unprepared allies.
- Boss phases with static mechanics (e.g., pillars) reward [`Breakthrough`][card-breakthrough] for lane control.
- Keep [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] for boss ultimates—you need stamina to reposition afterward.

## Common Pitfalls
- Ending in melee without block; always weave [`Momentum`][card-momentum] or [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard] before finishing.
- Skipping refuels—without [`Second Wind`][card-second-wind] backups, the deck bricks hard.
- Over-drafting charge cards without draw; keep hand density manageable.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
