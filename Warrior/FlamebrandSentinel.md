# Warrior Flamebrand Sentinel (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: ignite enemies with [`Burning Blade`][card-burning-blade] and [`Groundbreaker`][card-groundbreaker], then sustain via [`Cauterize Wound`][card-cauterize-wound] while blocking for the team.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (10/15) – relies on rare fire cards and attentive block sequencing.
- **Best in**: frontline co-op; handles elite pressure while allies mop up.
- **Key stats**: an upgraded [`Burning Blade`][card-burning-blade] stacks +4 burn per swing, and [`Cauterize Wound`][card-cauterize-wound] heals 6 HP after a big hit.

## Core Loop
1. Build block using [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard], [`Shield Block`][card-shield-block], and [`Ploughshares`][card-ploughshares] so you can keep swinging safely.
2. Apply burn with [`Burning Blade`][card-burning-blade], [`Groundbreaker`][card-groundbreaker], and [`Doom`][card-doom] for long-term chip.
3. Convert excess block into damage with [`Mighty Blow`][card-mighty-blow] or [`Whirlwind`][card-whirlwind], healing after each wave via [`Cauterize Wound`][card-cauterize-wound].

## Draft Priorities
- **Burn sources**: multiple [`Burning Blade`][card-burning-blade], [`Groundbreaker`][card-groundbreaker], and [`Doom`][card-doom]; prioritize upgrades on blade first.
- **Block core**: [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard], [`Shield Block`][card-shield-block], [`Tactics`][card-tactics] keep HP safe while you burn enemies down.
- **Finishers**: [`Mighty Blow`][card-mighty-blow], [`Whirlwind`][card-whirlwind], `All Out Strike` convert burn-weakened foes into fast kills.
- **Removals**: cut reckless charges; the deck wants measured swings that preserve HP.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Burning Blade`][card-burning-blade], then [`Groundbreaker`][card-groundbreaker]; [`Cauterize Wound`][card-cauterize-wound] third for bigger heals.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Burning Blade`][card-burning-blade], remove `Slam`/`Fury`, and invest gems into [`Sun`][card-sun]/[`Unagi`][card-unagi] for stamina sustain.
- **Vaults**: visit once burn package online; look for legendary burns or defensive relics.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Sun`][card-sun] – adds a [`Burning Blade`][card-burning-blade] each fight, accelerating ignition.
- [`Unagi`][card-unagi] – starting stamina lets you play block + burn combos on turn one.
- [`Tankard`][card-tankard] – draw from `Camaraderie` finds burn cards faster and covers allies with block.
- [`Broom`][card-broom] – cleanses negative effects so burn ticks aren’t interrupted by dazes.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Burn before you sweep: apply [`Burning Blade`][card-burning-blade], then finish with [`Whirlwind`][card-whirlwind] so burn kills stragglers.
- [`Cauterize Wound`][card-cauterize-wound] after lethal turns to heal; casting too early wastes the effect.
- Track burn stacks on elites; once they tick down to lethal, shift focus to new threats.
- Co-op: call out burning targets for Rogues/Mages—they deal bonus damage when hitting scorched enemies.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Burning Blade`][card-burning-blade] ×2 | 1 / Rare | Burn engine | Upgrade for +damage and burn stacks. |
| [`Groundbreaker`][card-groundbreaker] | 2 / Rare | AOE burn | Covers wide cones while staying midline. |
| [`Doom`][card-doom] | 2 / Rare | Single-target burn | Great on bosses/elite rushers. |
| [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard] | 1 / Common | Block | Bread-and-butter defense. |
| [`Shield Block`][card-shield-block] | 1 / Starter | Team block | Keep allies alive while burn ticks. |
| [`Tactics`][card-tactics] | 1 / Common | Draw + block | Maintain hand flow. |
| [`Whirlwind`][card-whirlwind] | 2 / Common | AOE finisher | Clears burned trash waves. |
| [`Cauterize Wound`][card-cauterize-wound] | 0 / Rare | Sustain | Heal after taking hits. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Mighty Blow`][card-mighty-blow], `All Out Strike`, or artifact cards to close fights. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- Double [`Burning Blade`][card-burning-blade] stacks 8 burn per turn; by turn three, elites melt without extra hits.
- [`Groundbreaker`][card-groundbreaker] with burn executes 12 HP waves on its own.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Burn persists through shields—focus bosses even when they turtle.
- Share blocks with [`Shield Block`][card-shield-block] before [`Cauterize Wound`][card-cauterize-wound] so allies recover from incidental damage.
- [`Sun`][card-sun] adds redundancy; if draws brick, you still start each fight with a burn outlet.

## Common Pitfalls
- Ignoring block; burn time means you must survive multiple enemy turns.
- Casting [`Cauterize Wound`][card-cauterize-wound] before damage arrives wastes healing—time it post-hit.
- Running too few burn cards; aim for at least five dedicated burn pieces.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
