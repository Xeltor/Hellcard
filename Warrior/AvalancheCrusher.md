# Warrior Avalanche Crusher (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: stack block with [`Barricade`][card-barricade]/[`Immutability`][card-immutability], then drop massive cones using [`Sticks and Stones`][card-sticks-and-stones], [`Whack 'em All`][card-whack-em-all], and [`Groundbreaker`][card-groundbreaker].
- **Difficulty**: High (12/15) – needs multiple rares and careful mana planning, but deletes entire waves when online.
- **Best in**: frontline solo; in co-op you’re the primary AOE finisher while allies focus on single-targets.
- **Key stats**: [`Sticks and Stones`][card-sticks-and-stones] deals twice your block; with [`Barricade`][card-barricade] up it snowballs into 30+ damage swings.

## Core Loop
1. Establish permanent block using [`Barricade`][card-barricade], [`Immutability`][card-immutability], and cheap enablers like [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard]/`Ploughshares`.
2. Use [`Knuckle Crack`][card-knuckle-crack]/[`Deep Breath`][card-deep-breath] to draw into payoffs while keeping block totals high.
3. Slam the board with [`Sticks and Stones`][card-sticks-and-stones], [`Whack 'em All`][card-whack-em-all], or [`Groundbreaker`][card-groundbreaker] to cash out damage without losing block thanks to [`Barricade`][card-barricade].

## Draft Priorities
- **Block engines**: [`Barricade`][card-barricade], [`Immutability`][card-immutability], [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard], `Ploughshares`, [`Turtle Up`][card-turtle-up]; upgrades on Barricade first.
- **Payoffs**: [`Sticks and Stones`][card-sticks-and-stones], [`Whack 'em All`][card-whack-em-all], [`Groundbreaker`][card-groundbreaker], [`Mighty Weaponry`][card-mighty-weaponry] for boss finishers.
- **Draw/support**: [`Knuckle Crack`][card-knuckle-crack], [`Deep Breath`][card-deep-breath], [`Tactics`][card-tactics] keep your hand full of block pieces.
- **Removals**: ditch low-value swords and charges—they dilute block density.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Barricade`][card-barricade], then [`Sticks and Stones`][card-sticks-and-stones]; [`Whack 'em All`][card-whack-em-all] third for wider cone damage.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Barricade`][card-barricade], remove aggressive lunges, and pick up artifacts that reward ending turns with block ([`Unripe Banana`][card-unripe-banana], [`Beetroot`][card-beetroot]).
- **Vaults**: target once you secure Barricade—legendary block tools (e.g., [`Iron Door`][card-iron-door]) push the build over the top.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Unripe Banana`][card-unripe-banana] – free block each turn compounds with Barricade scaling.
- [`Beetroot`][card-beetroot] – extra HP ensures you survive before Barricade appears.
- [`Talking Scabbard`][card-talking-scabbard] – upgrades leftover `Sword Slash` into `Heavy Sword` for spot single-target damage.
- [`Tankard`][card-tankard] – adds `Camaraderie` draw to find Barricade faster.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Always establish [`Barricade`][card-barricade] before cashing out block; otherwise [`Sticks and Stones`][card-sticks-and-stones] empties your defenses.
- [`Immutability`][card-immutability] on elite turns doubles as stun immunity—cast it before big swings.
- Save [`Whack 'em All`][card-whack-em-all] for clumped waves; it spends block but kills everything in one go when Barricade active.
- Co-op: announce when block is banked so allies can herd enemies into your cone.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Barricade`][card-barricade] | 2 / Rare | Block engine | Upgrade reduces cost to 1—top priority. |
| [`Immutability`][card-immutability] | 1 / Rare | Block retention | Prevents block loss from hits. |
| [`Safeguard`][card-safeguard] ×2 | 1 / Common | Cheap block | Fuel for Sticks and Stones. |
| `Ploughshares` | 0 / Common | Free block | Every turn block growth. |
| [`Turtle Up`][card-turtle-up] | 1 / Rare | Burst block | Adds armor while waiting on payoffs. |
| [`Sticks and Stones`][card-sticks-and-stones] | 2 / Rare | Main damage | Double block damage; unstoppable with Barricade. |
| [`Whack 'em All`][card-whack-em-all] | 2 / Rare | Wide AOE | Spends block for full-lane clear. |
| [`Groundbreaker`][card-groundbreaker] | 2 / Rare | Supplemental AOE | Great when enemies hold far lanes. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Knuckle Crack`][card-knuckle-crack], [`Tactics`][card-tactics], or artifact cards to find engines. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- 25 block + [`Sticks and Stones`][card-sticks-and-stones] = 50 cone damage while retaining block via Barricade.
- [`Whack 'em All`][card-whack-em-all] with 30 block wipes Act III waves outright.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Bank block before boss phases; once 40+ is stored you can loop damage forever.
- Share draw from [`Tankard`][card-tankard] so allies cycle while you guard front line.
- When Barricade hides, turtle with [`Turtle Up`][card-turtle-up] + [`Immutability`][card-immutability] until it appears.

## Common Pitfalls
- Playing [`Sticks and Stones`][card-sticks-and-stones] before Barricade—this often zeroes your block and leaves you exposed.
- Underestimating mana needs; payoffs cost 2 each so plan turns carefully.
- Forgetting [`Immutability`][card-immutability] expires; recast before major damage rounds.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
