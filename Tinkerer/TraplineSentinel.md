# Tinkerer Trapline Sentinel (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Medium (9/15) – trap setup is simple, but keeping sections covered for all 12 floors needs steady Screw income and smart activations.
- **Win condition**: seed lanes with traps (`Junk Trap`, `Tripwire Trap`, `Magnet Trap`), then detonate them with `Feathertouch`/`Spring Blade` while allies farm the marked or stunned enemies.[1][2][3][4]
- **Best in**: backline support—controls enemy movement, feeds screws, and softens elites so teammates finish.
- **Key stats**: `Trojan Trap` adds +1 damage to every attack in its section; chain two traps plus `Feathertouch` to stun and clear elite packs without taking hits.

## Core Loop
1. Deploy traps each turn: start with `Junk Trap` for screw income, follow with control traps like `Tripwire Trap` or `Magnet Trap` to prep a kill zone.[1][2][3]
2. Generate Screws through trap kills (`Junk Trap`, `Trojan Trap`) and support cards (`Gear Up`, `Magnet` if drafted), ensuring you can pay Feathertouch/Home Alone costs.[1][5]
3. Detonate when enemies pack into trapped sections using `Feathertouch`, `Spring Blade`, or `Home Alone`; re-seed traps immediately afterward.

## Draft Priorities
- **Trap base**: `Junk Trap`, `Tripwire Trap`, `Magnet Trap` (commons) keep lanes covered and provide Screws/mark.[1][2][3]
- **Payoffs**: `Feathertouch` (common) and `Spring Blade` (common) for stun/damage; upgrade to `Home Alone` or `Grid Strike` when offered.[4][6][7]
- **Support**: `Gear Up` and `Magnet` for extra Screws, `Jump Start` to trigger traps early in emergencies.[5][8][9]
- **Rares/Legendaries**: `Trojan Trap` (+1 damage & Screws), `Kill Zone Trap`, `Classic Trap`, or `Jack Trap` dramatically improve control.[10][11][12]
- **Removals**: cut low-value starters (`Screw Shot`) once you can rely on trap damage; keep a couple of direct attacks for bosses that avoid traps.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Junk Trap` (more Screws per kill) and `Feathertouch` (stun radius) early; follow with `Tripwire Trap` or `Spring Blade` depending on needs.[1][4]
- **Hideout**: remove redundant attacks, pin `Junk Trap` or `Feathertouch`, and grab gems until you can afford trap artifacts like `Scout Badge` or `Screw Making Mold`.[13]
- **Vaults**: optional—only visit once Screws and traps are online; losing gems too early delays artifact purchases that keep traps flowing.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Scout Badge` – reshapes your deck around traps immediately, perfect start for this build.[14]
- `Screw Making Mold` – passive 1–2 Screws per turn covers activation costs without burning cards.[15]
- `Transmission Belt` – draws on repeated trap activations, keeping your hand healthy on long fights.[16]
- `Party Hat` – upgrades starters into trap-friendly cards (`Piñata`, `Sugar Rush`) for extra Screws/draw.[17]
- Standard gem artifacts (`Silver Spoon`, `Clam`) help hit upgrade benchmarks if you whiff trap relics early.[18][19]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Place traps before detonating; `Feathertouch` removes the trap, so have another ready for the next wave.[4]
- `Tripwire Trap` adds mark—call it out so allies target that enemy for bonus damage.[2]
- `Magnet Trap`/`Acid Trap` strip block before you fire multi-hit allies; save them for shielded elites.[3]
- Stagger trap placement across sections so you always have a safe lane; don’t cluster everything in one spot unless you can guarantee a wipe.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Screw/Core | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Junk Trap` ×2 | 0 / Common | 1 Core | Economy trap | Screws from kills; backbone of the build.[1] |
| `Tripwire Trap` | 0 / Common | 2 Screws | Mark trap | Sets up ally damage and screw gain.[2] |
| `Magnet Trap` | 0 / Common | 2 Screws | Block shred | Keep in lanes with armored enemies.[3] |
| `Feathertouch` | 0 / Common | 5 Screws | Stun payoff | Removes trap after use; hold for elite waves.[4] |
| `Spring Blade` | 1 / Common | — | Damage payoff | Gains splash damage in trapped sections.[6] |
| `Gear Up` | 1 / Starter | — | Block + screws | Fills screw gap on slower turns.[5] |
| `Jump Start` | 1 / Common | — | Emergency trigger | Fire trap instantly when needed.[9] |
| Flex 1 | — | — | Trap upgrade | `Trojan Trap` or `Kill Zone Trap` for scaling.[10][11] |
| Flex 2 | — | — | Utility | `Cannibalize`, `Transmission Belt` artifact draws, or movement tech depending on drops.[16][20] |

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Trojan Trap` + allies: +1 (later +2) damage per hit; a marked/stunned enemy melts to basic attacks.[10]
- `Feathertouch` stun radius covers entire lane; with `Grid Strike`, trapped lanes take 10+ damage per enemy when stacked.[4][7]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Call which lane is trapped so teammates corral enemies there; `Kick` from Rogue allies pairs nicely with your traps.
- Save `Feathertouch` for boss adds; trap the spawn tile during phase transitions so new enemies arrive stunned/marked.
- Bring defensive artifacts (`Pop-up Shield` via drops) if your team lacks frontline—you’re usually in the back, but stray hits happen.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting trap upkeep—some (Paint/Classic) consume Screws for stuns; ensure you have Screws before end of turn.
- Detonating too early; let enemies pile up in a trap before firing `Spring Blade`/`Feathertouch` to maximize payoff.
- Neglecting removals; too many non-trap attacks clog hands and slow setup.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
