# Tinkerer Trapline Sentinel (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Medium (9/15) – trap setup is simple, but keeping sections covered for all 12 floors needs steady Screw income and smart activations.
- **Win condition**: seed lanes with traps ([`Junk Trap`][card-junk-trap], [`Tripwire Trap`][card-tripwire-trap], [`Magnet Trap`][card-magnet-trap]), then detonate them with [`Feathertouch`][card-feathertouch]/[`Spring Blade`][card-spring-blade] while allies farm the marked or stunned enemies.
- **Best in**: backline support—controls enemy movement, feeds screws, and softens elites so teammates finish.
- **Key stats**: [`Trojan Trap`][card-trojan-trap] adds +1 damage to every attack in its section; chain two traps plus [`Feathertouch`][card-feathertouch] to stun and clear elite packs without taking hits.

## Core Loop
1. Deploy traps each turn: start with [`Junk Trap`][card-junk-trap] for screw income, follow with control traps like [`Tripwire Trap`][card-tripwire-trap] or [`Magnet Trap`][card-magnet-trap] to prep a kill zone.
2. Generate Screws through trap kills ([`Junk Trap`][card-junk-trap], [`Trojan Trap`][card-trojan-trap]) and support cards ([`Gear Up`][card-gear-up], [`Magnet`][card-magnet] if drafted), ensuring you can pay Feathertouch/Home Alone costs.
3. Detonate when enemies pack into trapped sections using [`Feathertouch`][card-feathertouch], [`Spring Blade`][card-spring-blade], or `Home Alone`; re-seed traps immediately afterward.

## Draft Priorities
- **Trap base**: [`Junk Trap`][card-junk-trap], [`Tripwire Trap`][card-tripwire-trap], [`Magnet Trap`][card-magnet-trap] (commons) keep lanes covered and provide Screws/mark.
- **Payoffs**: [`Feathertouch`][card-feathertouch] (common) and [`Spring Blade`][card-spring-blade] (common) for stun/damage; upgrade to `Home Alone` or [`Grid Strike`][card-grid-strike] when offered.
- **Support**: [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up] and [`Magnet`][card-magnet] for extra Screws, [`Jump Start`][card-jump-start] to trigger traps early in emergencies.
- **Rares/Legendaries**: [`Trojan Trap`][card-trojan-trap] (+1 damage & Screws), [`Kill Zone Trap`][card-kill-zone-trap], `Classic Trap`, or [`Jack Trap`][card-jack-trap] dramatically improve control.
- **Removals**: cut low-value starters (`Screw Shot`) once you can rely on trap damage; keep a couple of direct attacks for bosses that avoid traps.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Junk Trap`][card-junk-trap] (more Screws per kill) and [`Feathertouch`][card-feathertouch] (stun radius) early; follow with [`Tripwire Trap`][card-tripwire-trap] or [`Spring Blade`][card-spring-blade] depending on needs.
- **Hideout**: remove redundant attacks, pin [`Junk Trap`][card-junk-trap] or [`Feathertouch`][card-feathertouch], and grab gems until you can afford trap artifacts like [`Scout Badge`][card-scout-badge] or [`Screw Making Mold`][card-screw-making-mold].
- **Vaults**: optional—only visit once Screws and traps are online; losing gems too early delays artifact purchases that keep traps flowing.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Scout Badge`][card-scout-badge] – reshapes your deck around traps immediately, perfect start for this build.
- [`Screw Making Mold`][card-screw-making-mold] – passive 1–2 Screws per turn covers activation costs without burning cards.
- [`Transmission Belt`][card-transmission-belt] – draws on repeated trap activations, keeping your hand healthy on long fights.
- [`Party Hat`][card-party-hat] – upgrades starters into trap-friendly cards (`Piñata`, `Sugar Rush`) for extra Screws/draw.
- Standard gem artifacts ([`Silver Spoon`][card-silver-spoon], [`Clam`][card-clam]) help hit upgrade benchmarks if you whiff trap relics early.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Place traps before detonating; [`Feathertouch`][card-feathertouch] removes the trap, so have another ready for the next wave.
- [`Tripwire Trap`][card-tripwire-trap] adds mark—call it out so allies target that enemy for bonus damage.
- [`Magnet Trap`][card-magnet-trap]/`Acid Trap` strip block before you fire multi-hit allies; save them for shielded elites.
- Stagger trap placement across sections so you always have a safe lane; don’t cluster everything in one spot unless you can guarantee a wipe.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Screw/Core | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Junk Trap`][card-junk-trap] ×2 | 0 / Common | 1 Core | Economy trap | Screws from kills; backbone of the build. |
| [`Tripwire Trap`][card-tripwire-trap] | 0 / Common | 2 Screws | Mark trap | Sets up ally damage and screw gain. |
| [`Magnet Trap`][card-magnet-trap] | 0 / Common | 2 Screws | Block shred | Keep in lanes with armored enemies. |
| [`Feathertouch`][card-feathertouch] | 0 / Common | 5 Screws | Stun payoff | Removes trap after use; hold for elite waves. |
| [`Spring Blade`][card-spring-blade] | 1 / Common | — | Damage payoff | Gains splash damage in trapped sections. |
| [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up] | 1 / Starter | — | Block + screws | Fills screw gap on slower turns. |
| [`Jump Start`][card-jump-start] | 1 / Common | — | Emergency trigger | Fire trap instantly when needed. |
| Flex 1 | — | — | Trap upgrade | [`Trojan Trap`][card-trojan-trap] or [`Kill Zone Trap`][card-kill-zone-trap] for scaling. |
| Flex 2 | — | — | Utility | [`Cannibalize`][card-cannibalize], [`Transmission Belt`][card-transmission-belt] artifact draws, or movement tech depending on drops. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Trojan Trap`][card-trojan-trap] + allies: +1 (later +2) damage per hit; a marked/stunned enemy melts to basic attacks.
- [`Feathertouch`][card-feathertouch] stun radius covers entire lane; with [`Grid Strike`][card-grid-strike], trapped lanes take 10+ damage per enemy when stacked.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Call which lane is trapped so teammates corral enemies there; `Kick` from Rogue allies pairs nicely with your traps.
- Save [`Feathertouch`][card-feathertouch] for boss adds; trap the spawn tile during phase transitions so new enemies arrive stunned/marked.
- Bring defensive artifacts (`Pop-up Shield` via drops) if your team lacks frontline—you’re usually in the back, but stray hits happen.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting trap upkeep—some (Paint/Classic) consume Screws for stuns; ensure you have Screws before end of turn.
- Detonating too early; let enemies pile up in a trap before firing [`Spring Blade`][card-spring-blade]/[`Feathertouch`][card-feathertouch] to maximize payoff.
- Neglecting removals; too many non-trap attacks clog hands and slow setup.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
