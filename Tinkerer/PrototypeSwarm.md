# Tinkerer Prototype Swarm (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: flood the board with contraptions using [`Prototype`][card-prototype], [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production], and [`Reuse`][card-reuse], then cash them out with [`Core Dump`][card-core-dump] or [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon] chains.
- **Difficulty**: High (12/15) – managing slot order, upkeep costs, and removal loops over 12 floors demands planning, but the damage ceiling is enormous.
- **Best in**: mid/backline engineer; excels at sustained AOE that scales endlessly once the swarm is established.
- **Key stats**: [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production] + [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] adds 5+ Screws per turn; [`Core Dump`][card-core-dump] deals 25× the number of contraption types removed, erasing boss add phases.

## Core Loop
1. Deploy contraptions ([`Prototype`][card-prototype], [`Popping Wrist`][card-popping-wrist], [`Fire Sprinkler`][card-fire-sprinkler], `Converter`) to fill the lane with persistent effects.
2. Use [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production]/[`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] to generate Screws while contraptions fire; maintain Cores via [`Reuse`][card-reuse]/`Electrolysis` so you can double triggers.
3. When the board is saturated, detonate with `Engage`, [`Reuse`][card-reuse], or [`Core Dump`][card-core-dump] to wipe enemies, then rebuild immediately.

## Draft Priorities
- **Contraption sources**: [`Prototype`][card-prototype], [`Popping Wrist`][card-popping-wrist], [`Fire Sprinkler`][card-fire-sprinkler], `Converter`, [`Tabletop Trebuchet`][card-tabletop-trebuchet]—take any reliable damage trap.
- **Resource engines**: [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production], [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production], `Electrolysis`, [`Battery`][card-battery] keep Screws/Cores flowing.
- **Activators**: [`Jump Start`][card-jump-start], `Engage`, [`Reuse`][card-reuse], [`Cannibalize`][card-cannibalize] give precise control over the contraption row.
- **Finishers**: [`Core Dump`][card-core-dump], [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon], `Overpressure` handle bosses when it’s time to cash out.
- **Removals**: eliminate basic `Screw Shot`; the deck wants contraptions and activators only.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Prototype`][card-prototype] or key contraptions first, then [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production] for extra Screws and [`Core Dump`][card-core-dump] for final burst.
- **Hideout**: remove non-engine cards, Plan [`Prototype`][card-prototype], and invest gems until you secure supportive artifacts ([`Transmission Belt`][card-transmission-belt], [`Jack`][card-jack]).
- **Vaults**: good source of extra relics once the swarm exists; the build scales with every contraption you add.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Transmission Belt`][card-transmission-belt] – draws when you re-trigger contraptions, perfect for [`Reuse`][card-reuse] turns.
- [`Jack`][card-jack] – gain Screws + a Core after idle turns, smoothing rebuilds post-[`Core Dump`][card-core-dump].
- [`Screw Making Mold`][card-screw-making-mold] – guarantees Screws so upkeep costs never stall you.
- [`Battery Charger`][card-battery-charger] – extra draw when holding Cores keeps contraption hands flowing.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Order contraptions deliberately: put damage machines ([`Fire Sprinkler`][card-fire-sprinkler], [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon]) first so [`Jump Start`][card-jump-start] hits them.
- Use [`Reuse`][card-reuse] on your strongest contraption before removing it—double activation plus a Core/Screw refund.
- Fire [`Core Dump`][card-core-dump] only after the board is full; losing all contraptions mid-wave is lethal if you don’t rebuild immediately.
- Keep track of Screw costs; reserve enough to pay upkeep for contraptions that require Screws each turn.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Prototype`][card-prototype] ×2 | 0 | Core contraption | Baseline damage; upgrade for double-play.
| [`Popping Wrist`][card-popping-wrist] | 0 | Multi-hit contraption | Great for repeat [`Jump Start`][card-jump-start] activations.
| [`Fire Sprinkler`][card-fire-sprinkler] | 0 | Cone damage | Unblockable AOE every enemy turn.
| `Converter` or [`Tabletop Trebuchet`][card-tabletop-trebuchet] | 0 | Utility contraption | Provides Screws or splash.
| [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production] | 0 | Resource engine | Huge Screw gain; manage Core upkeep.
| [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] | 0 | Passive screws | Keeps upkeep covered.
| [`Jump Start`][card-jump-start] | 1 | Activation | Fires first contraption instantly.
| [`Reuse`][card-reuse] | 1 | Double + remove | Activates then refunds Screws/Cores.
| [`Core Dump`][card-core-dump] | 0 | Finisher | Massive damage when removing multiple contraptions.
| Flex slot | — | Utility | `Engage`, [`Cannibalize`][card-cannibalize], or defensive contraptions as needed.

## Damage Benchmarks
- Three contraption types removed by [`Core Dump`][card-core-dump] = 30 damage to all enemies; easily scales higher mid-run.
- [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon] with a Core deals 20 damage across two targets per turn; combine with [`Jump Start`][card-jump-start] for burst.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Let allies know when [`Core Dump`][card-core-dump] is coming so they herd enemies into the blast radius.
- For bosses, keep damage contraptions active while saving [`Reuse`][card-reuse] for the exact threshold—double-triggering [`Fire Sprinkler`][card-fire-sprinkler] or `Overpressure` deletes phases.
- Coordinate with support allies so they provide block while you rebuild after detonations.

## Common Pitfalls
- Removing contraptions without a plan; always have replacements ready post-[`Core Dump`][card-core-dump].
- Forgetting upkeep—some contraptions shut down if you end turn without Screws.
- Running out of draw; prioritize artifacts and cards that refill your hand after big activation turns.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
