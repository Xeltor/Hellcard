# Tinkerer Prototype Swarm (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: flood the board with contraptions using `Prototype`, `Mass Production`, and `Reuse`, then cash them out with `Core Dump` or `Shoulder Cannon` chains.
- **Difficulty**: High (12/15) – managing slot order, upkeep costs, and removal loops over 12 floors demands planning, but the damage ceiling is enormous.
- **Best in**: mid/backline engineer; excels at sustained AOE that scales endlessly once the swarm is established.
- **Key stats**: `Mass Production` + `Means of Production` adds 5+ Screws per turn; `Core Dump` deals 25× the number of contraption types removed, erasing boss add phases.[1][2][3]

## Core Loop
1. Deploy contraptions (`Prototype`, `Popping Wrist`, `Fire Sprinkler`, `Converter`) to fill the lane with persistent effects.[1][4][5]
2. Use `Mass Production`/`Means of Production` to generate Screws while contraptions fire; maintain Cores via `Reuse`/`Electrolysis` so you can double triggers.[2][6]
3. When the board is saturated, detonate with `Engage`, `Reuse`, or `Core Dump` to wipe enemies, then rebuild immediately.

## Draft Priorities
- **Contraption sources**: `Prototype`, `Popping Wrist`, `Fire Sprinkler`, `Converter`, `Tabletop Trebuchet`—take any reliable damage trap.[1][4][5][7]
- **Resource engines**: `Mass Production`, `Means of Production`, `Electrolysis`, `Battery` keep Screws/Cores flowing.[2][6][8]
- **Activators**: `Jump Start`, `Engage`, `Reuse`, `Cannibalize` give precise control over the contraption row.[9][10][11]
- **Finishers**: `Core Dump`, `Shoulder Cannon`, `Overpressure` handle bosses when it’s time to cash out.[3][12]
- **Removals**: eliminate basic `Screw Shot`; the deck wants contraptions and activators only.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Prototype` or key contraptions first, then `Mass Production` for extra Screws and `Core Dump` for final burst.[1][2][3]
- **Hideout**: remove non-engine cards, Plan `Prototype`, and invest gems until you secure supportive artifacts (`Transmission Belt`, `Jack`).[13]
- **Vaults**: good source of extra relics once the swarm exists; the build scales with every contraption you add.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Transmission Belt` – draws when you re-trigger contraptions, perfect for `Reuse` turns.[13]
- `Jack` – gain Screws + a Core after idle turns, smoothing rebuilds post-`Core Dump`.[14]
- `Screw Making Mold` – guarantees Screws so upkeep costs never stall you.[15]
- `Battery Charger` – extra draw when holding Cores keeps contraption hands flowing.[16]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Order contraptions deliberately: put damage machines (`Fire Sprinkler`, `Shoulder Cannon`) first so `Jump Start` hits them.[5][12]
- Use `Reuse` on your strongest contraption before removing it—double activation plus a Core/Screw refund.[10]
- Fire `Core Dump` only after the board is full; losing all contraptions mid-wave is lethal if you don’t rebuild immediately.[3]
- Keep track of Screw costs; reserve enough to pay upkeep for contraptions that require Screws each turn.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Prototype` ×2 | 0 | Core contraption | Baseline damage; upgrade for double-play.
| `Popping Wrist` | 0 | Multi-hit contraption | Great for repeat `Jump Start` activations.[4]
| `Fire Sprinkler` | 0 | Cone damage | Unblockable AOE every enemy turn.[5]
| `Converter` or `Tabletop Trebuchet` | 0 | Utility contraption | Provides Screws or splash.[7]
| `Mass Production` | 0 | Resource engine | Huge Screw gain; manage Core upkeep.[2]
| `Means of Production` | 0 | Passive screws | Keeps upkeep covered.[2]
| `Jump Start` | 1 | Activation | Fires first contraption instantly.[9]
| `Reuse` | 1 | Double + remove | Activates then refunds Screws/Cores.[10]
| `Core Dump` | 0 | Finisher | Massive damage when removing multiple contraptions.[3]
| Flex slot | — | Utility | `Engage`, `Cannibalize`, or defensive contraptions as needed.[11]

## Damage Benchmarks
- Three contraption types removed by `Core Dump` = 30 damage to all enemies; easily scales higher mid-run.[3]
- `Shoulder Cannon` with a Core deals 20 damage across two targets per turn; combine with `Jump Start` for burst.[12]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Let allies know when `Core Dump` is coming so they herd enemies into the blast radius.
- For bosses, keep damage contraptions active while saving `Reuse` for the exact threshold—double-triggering `Fire Sprinkler` or `Overpressure` deletes phases.
- Coordinate with support allies so they provide block while you rebuild after detonations.

## Common Pitfalls
- Removing contraptions without a plan; always have replacements ready post-`Core Dump`.
- Forgetting upkeep—some contraptions shut down if you end turn without Screws.
- Running out of draw; prioritize artifacts and cards that refill your hand after big activation turns.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
