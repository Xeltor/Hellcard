# Tinkerer Steam Turbine Engineer (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: loop energy engines—[`Flywheel`][card-flywheel], [`Field Flux`][card-field-flux], [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up], [`Booster Boots`][card-booster-boots]—to generate mana and card advantage, then spend surplus on [`Ribauldequin`][card-ribauldequin]/[`Iron Rain`][card-iron-rain] to flatten waves.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (9/15) – sequencing generators and upgrades takes a few runs but is consistent afterward.
- **Best in**: co-op backline; shares energy buffs with allies while anchoring damage.
- **Key stats**: upgraded [`Flywheel`][card-flywheel] gives +2 mana every other turn, and [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up] discounts devices globally.

## Core Loop
1. Play generators each turn ([`Flywheel`][card-flywheel], [`Field Flux`][card-field-flux], [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up]) to stack mana refunds.
2. Use [`Booster Boots`][card-booster-boots] and [`Lathe`][card-lathe] to reduce device costs and draw into payoffs.
3. Spend excess mana on heavy hitters like [`Iron Rain`][card-iron-rain], [`Ribauldequin`][card-ribauldequin], or [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production] to flood the board with gadgets.

## Draft Priorities
- **Engines**: prioritize [`Flywheel`][card-flywheel], [`Field Flux`][card-field-flux], [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up], [`Booster Boots`][card-booster-boots]; upgrade Flywheel first.
- **Payoffs**: [`Iron Rain`][card-iron-rain], [`Ribauldequin`][card-ribauldequin], [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production], [`Compact Catapult`][card-compact-catapult] to sink mana.
- **Support**: [`Capacitor`][card-capacitor], [`Battery`][card-battery], `Field Repairs` keep the machine running safely.
- **Removals**: cut high-cost bombs that lack synergy with energy loop.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: [`Flywheel`][card-flywheel] → [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up] → [`Iron Rain`][card-iron-rain] for immediate scaling.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Flywheel`][card-flywheel], remove dead weight, invest gems into artifacts that add generators ([`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production], [`Battery`][card-battery]).
- **Vaults**: strong; legendary engines like `Singularity` push mana over the top.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Battery`][card-battery] – refunds mana after devices, fueling loop turns.
- [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] – extra gadgets from your engines.
- [`Quicksort`][card-quicksort] – sorts draws so you always open with generators.
- [`Tough Tabard`][card-tough-tabard] – defensive padding when you take a turn off to spin up.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Play generators before payoffs; order matters for mana refunds.
- [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up] early multiplies later turns—cast it before deploying devices.
- Use [`Booster Boots`][card-booster-boots] to reposition when enemies rush the backline; you need space for deployables.
- Co-op: share mana buffs by timing [`Field Flux`][card-field-flux] when allies have big turns queued.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Flywheel`][card-flywheel] ×2 | 1 / Rare | Mana engine | Upgrade for faster ramp. |
| [`Field Flux`][card-field-flux] | 0 / Rare | Mana burst | Grants mana to whole team. |
| [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up] | 1 / Common | Cost reducer | Essential for device spam. |
| [`Booster Boots`][card-booster-boots] | 0 / Rare | Draw + reposition | Keeps you safe and fuels turns. |
| [`Lathe`][card-lathe] | 1 / Rare | Draw | Sculpt hand toward payoffs. |
| [`Iron Rain`][card-iron-rain] | 2 / Rare | Mana sink | Massive cone damage. |
| [`Ribauldequin`][card-ribauldequin] | 2 / Rare | Burst | Great on full boards. |
| [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production] | 2 / Rare | Gadget swarm | Converts spare mana into defense. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Capacitor`][card-capacitor], `Field Repairs`, or artifact tech as needed. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- Fully ramped [`Flywheel`][card-flywheel] + [`Field Flux`][card-field-flux] enables triple-device turns totaling 20+ damage.
- [`Iron Rain`][card-iron-rain] at +2 mana from engines hits 18 damage cone consistently.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Share [`Field Flux`][card-field-flux] right before ally burst turns—extra mana is huge.
- Use [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production] to give teammates cover against bosses with adds.
- Keep [`Booster Boots`][card-booster-boots] ready for boss teleports; staying alive keeps engines running.

## Common Pitfalls
- Playing payoffs before generators; you’ll starve future turns of mana.
- Forgetting to upgrade [`Flywheel`][card-flywheel]—base version ramps too slowly.
- Neglecting defense; add `Field Repairs` or [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production] shields early.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
