# Tinkerer Screw Barricade (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Low (7/15) – forgiving screw-to-block loop that comfortably shields the team throughout all 12 floors.
- **Win condition**: generate block for the party with [`Field Repairs`][card-field-repairs], [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig], and [`Gauntlet`][card-gauntlet], then cash extra Screws into damage via `Hammer Throw`/[`Screwdriver`][card-screwdriver] while allies mop up.
- **Best in**: frontline co-op anchor or solo midline; you tank hits, feed block, and still contribute damage through Screw scaling.
- **Key stats**: [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig] converts every Screw into 1 block (3 with a Core); after a couple of [`Field Repairs`][card-field-repairs], you can guarantee 20+ block for the whole party each boss turn.

## Core Loop
1. Use [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up], [`Field Repairs`][card-field-repairs], and [`Magnet`][card-magnet] to build Screws while keeping your block high.
2. Spend Screws with [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig]/[`Gauntlet`][card-gauntlet] to shield the team, or convert them into single-target damage using [`Screwdriver`][card-screwdriver] and `Hammer Throw` when the lane is safe.
3. Refill Screws with trap kills (`Junk Trap` if drafted), artifacts ([`Screw Making Mold`][card-screw-making-mold]), or repeated generators ([`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production]) to maintain the defensive cycle.

## Draft Priorities
- **Block engines**: [`Field Repairs`][card-field-repairs], [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up], [`Metalworks`][card-metalworks], `Tactics` (if offered) – your first priority is shielding the party.
- **Screw spenders**: [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig], [`Gauntlet`][card-gauntlet], [`Screwdriver`][card-screwdriver], `Hammer Throw`; these turn defense into stuns/damage.
- **Resource boosters**: [`Magnet`][card-magnet], `Junk Trap` (if traps appear), [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production], `Mass Production` for passive Screw income.
- **Core tools**: [`Electrolysis`][card-electrolysis] or [`Potato`][card-potato] ensure you have the Cores needed to supercharge Whirligig turns.
- **Removals**: trim basic `Screw Shot` once you have better Screw generators; keep at least one cheap attack for finishing low-HP enemies.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Field Repairs`][card-field-repairs] (more block), then [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig]/[`Gauntlet`][card-gauntlet] so team-wide shielding scales; follow with [`Magnet`][card-magnet] for extra Screw gain.
- **Hideout**: remove dead cards, use **Plan** to pin [`Field Repairs`][card-field-repairs], and gift gems until defensive artifacts ([`Screw Making Mold`][card-screw-making-mold], [`Battery Charger`][card-battery-charger]) are affordable.
- **Vaults**: optional—take them when you already have Screw engines online; otherwise prioritize Armory/Hideout to strengthen the loop.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Screw Making Mold`][card-screw-making-mold] – passive 1–2 Screws per turn keeps Whirligig ready.
- [`Battery Charger`][card-battery-charger] – +1 draw when you hold a Core, perfect for defensive turns where you want multiple block cards.
- [`Party Hat`][card-party-hat] – upgrades `Screw Shot` into `Piñata`, boosting Screw generation.
- [`Jack`][card-jack] – provides Screws + a Core on idle turns, ideal after big boss phases when you need to rebuild.
- Generic gems ([`Silver Spoon`][card-silver-spoon], [`Clam`][card-clam]) still matter for hitting early Armory upgrades.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Play Screw generators before [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig]; every spare Screw raises team block.
- If you see a big hit coming, stack block ([`Field Repairs`][card-field-repairs], [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up]), then fire [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig]/[`Gauntlet`][card-gauntlet] to share it – hold Cores for ×3 block turns in boss phases.
- Use [`Screwdriver`][card-screwdriver] to stun priority targets when your Screw count is high; it keeps them from breaking your block while you rebuild.
- Co-op: call out when Whirligig is primed so allies can plan risky turns knowing block will arrive.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up] ×2 | 1 / Starter | Block + Screw | Cheap +1 Screw while shielding allies.
| [`Field Repairs`][card-field-repairs] ×2 | 1 / Common | Team block | +3 block + Screws; upgrade first.
| [`Magnet`][card-magnet] | 1 / Common | Screw generator | Pairs with Cores for big Screw spikes.
| [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig] | 0 / Common | Team block dump | Consume Screws for party block; use Cores for ×3.
| [`Gauntlet`][card-gauntlet] | 0 / Rare | Backup block | Similar to Whirligig; run both if possible.
| [`Screwdriver`][card-screwdriver] | 1 / Rare | Stun payoff | Converts Screws into unstoppable stun hits.
| `Hammer Throw` | 1 / Common | Screw-scaling damage | Good once lane is trapped or thinned.
| Flex slots | — | Utility | [`Electrolysis`][card-electrolysis] for Cores, `Junk Trap` for passive Screws, or [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] for passive gain. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Hammer Throw`: at 8 Screws deals 16 damage down a lane; upgrade early to wipe far sections.
- [`Screwdriver`][card-screwdriver]: 6 damage + stun (unblockable) when fueled by Screws; excellent for elite control.
- [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig]: 10 Screws → 10 block for everyone (30 with Core), enough to blank most boss swings.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Feed mana-focused relics to allies; you supply the defense. In return, let them handle burst damage.
- For bosses, stockpile Screws/ Cores the turn before thresholds so you can Whirligig + Screwdriver without running dry.
- Coordinate with allies to move bosses into safe lanes once your block is up; you can tank hits while they focus on damage.

## Common Pitfalls
- Spending all Screws on damage—always leave some for Whirligig during enemy turns.
- Overusing `Science!`/[`Electrolysis`][card-electrolysis] when you already hold multiple Cores; Strain adds up and reduces late-floor consistency.
- Forgetting to upgrade block cards; without bigger numbers, late-floor elites will chunk through your shield.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
