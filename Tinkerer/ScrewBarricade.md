# Tinkerer Screw Barricade (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Low (7/15) – forgiving screw-to-block loop that comfortably shields the team throughout all 12 floors.
- **Win condition**: generate block for the party with `Field Repairs`, `Whirligig`, and `Gauntlet`, then cash extra Screws into damage via `Hammer Throw`/`Screwdriver` while allies mop up.[1][2][3][4]
- **Best in**: frontline co-op anchor or solo midline; you tank hits, feed block, and still contribute damage through Screw scaling.
- **Key stats**: `Whirligig` converts every Screw into 1 block (3 with a Core); after a couple of `Field Repairs`, you can guarantee 20+ block for the whole party each boss turn.

## Core Loop
1. Use `Gear Up`, `Field Repairs`, and `Magnet` to build Screws while keeping your block high.[1][2][5]
2. Spend Screws with `Whirligig`/`Gauntlet` to shield the team, or convert them into single-target damage using `Screwdriver` and `Hammer Throw` when the lane is safe.[3][4]
3. Refill Screws with trap kills (`Junk Trap` if drafted), artifacts (`Screw Making Mold`), or repeated generators (`Means of Production`) to maintain the defensive cycle.[6][7]

## Draft Priorities
- **Block engines**: `Field Repairs`, `Gear Up`, `Metalworks`, `Tactics` (if offered) – your first priority is shielding the party.[1][2][8]
- **Screw spenders**: `Whirligig`, `Gauntlet`, `Screwdriver`, `Hammer Throw`; these turn defense into stuns/damage.[3][4][9]
- **Resource boosters**: `Magnet`, `Junk Trap` (if traps appear), `Means of Production`, `Mass Production` for passive Screw income.[5][6][7]
- **Core tools**: `Electrolysis` or `Potato` ensure you have the Cores needed to supercharge Whirligig turns.[10][11]
- **Removals**: trim basic `Screw Shot` once you have better Screw generators; keep at least one cheap attack for finishing low-HP enemies.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Field Repairs` (more block), then `Whirligig`/`Gauntlet` so team-wide shielding scales; follow with `Magnet` for extra Screw gain.[1][3][5]
- **Hideout**: remove dead cards, use **Plan** to pin `Field Repairs`, and gift gems until defensive artifacts (`Screw Making Mold`, `Battery Charger`) are affordable.[12]
- **Vaults**: optional—take them when you already have Screw engines online; otherwise prioritize Armory/Hideout to strengthen the loop.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Screw Making Mold` – passive 1–2 Screws per turn keeps Whirligig ready.[6]
- `Battery Charger` – +1 draw when you hold a Core, perfect for defensive turns where you want multiple block cards.[13]
- `Party Hat` – upgrades `Screw Shot` into `Piñata`, boosting Screw generation.[14]
- `Jack` – provides Screws + a Core on idle turns, ideal after big boss phases when you need to rebuild.[15]
- Generic gems (`Silver Spoon`, `Clam`) still matter for hitting early Armory upgrades.[16][17]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Play Screw generators before `Whirligig`; every spare Screw raises team block.[3]
- If you see a big hit coming, stack block (`Field Repairs`, `Gear Up`), then fire `Whirligig`/`Gauntlet` to share it – hold Cores for ×3 block turns in boss phases.[1][3]
- Use `Screwdriver` to stun priority targets when your Screw count is high; it keeps them from breaking your block while you rebuild.[4]
- Co-op: call out when Whirligig is primed so allies can plan risky turns knowing block will arrive.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Gear Up` ×2 | 1 / Starter | Block + Screw | Cheap +1 Screw while shielding allies.[1]
| `Field Repairs` ×2 | 1 / Common | Team block | +3 block + Screws; upgrade first.[2]
| `Magnet` | 1 / Common | Screw generator | Pairs with Cores for big Screw spikes.[5]
| `Whirligig` | 0 / Common | Team block dump | Consume Screws for party block; use Cores for ×3.[3]
| `Gauntlet` | 0 / Rare | Backup block | Similar to Whirligig; run both if possible.[9]
| `Screwdriver` | 1 / Rare | Stun payoff | Converts Screws into unstoppable stun hits.[4]
| `Hammer Throw` | 1 / Common | Screw-scaling damage | Good once lane is trapped or thinned.[4]
| Flex slots | — | Utility | `Electrolysis` for Cores, `Junk Trap` for passive Screws, or `Means of Production` for passive gain.[6][7][10] |

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Hammer Throw`: at 8 Screws deals 16 damage down a lane; upgrade early to wipe far sections.[4]
- `Screwdriver`: 6 damage + stun (unblockable) when fueled by Screws; excellent for elite control.[4]
- `Whirligig`: 10 Screws → 10 block for everyone (30 with Core), enough to blank most boss swings.[3]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Feed mana-focused relics to allies; you supply the defense. In return, let them handle burst damage.
- For bosses, stockpile Screws/ Cores the turn before thresholds so you can Whirligig + Screwdriver without running dry.
- Coordinate with allies to move bosses into safe lanes once your block is up; you can tank hits while they focus on damage.

## Common Pitfalls
- Spending all Screws on damage—always leave some for Whirligig during enemy turns.
- Overusing `Science!`/`Electrolysis` when you already hold multiple Cores; Strain adds up and reduces late-floor consistency.
- Forgetting to upgrade block cards; without bigger numbers, late-floor elites will chunk through your shield.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
