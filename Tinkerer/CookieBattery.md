# Tinkerer Cookie Battery (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: loop [`Sugar Rush`][card-sugar-rush], [`Cookie Cutter`][card-cookie-cutter], and `Cookie` summons to convert spare mana into Screws, then spend them on party-wide block with [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig] or direct damage via [`Hammer Throw`][card-hammer-throw].
- **Difficulty**: Low (6/15) – very forgiving; as long as you keep baking cookies, the loop sustains the whole 12-floor run.
- **Best in**: backline support or mid slot; you feed mana/draw to allies while scaling Screws for defense or burst.
- **Key stats**: every `Cookie` grants 2 Screws (plus mana/draw when Core is used); two cycles per turn fuel [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig] for 10+ block per hero.

## Core Loop
1. Cast [`Sugar Rush`][card-sugar-rush]/[`Cookie Cutter`][card-cookie-cutter] to add `Cookie` cards; play them to gain Screws, draw, and optionally mana.
2. Convert Screws into block via [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig]/`Gauntlet` or into damage with [`Hammer Throw`][card-hammer-throw]/[`Screwdriver`][card-screwdriver].
3. Repeat each turn, ensuring you end with enough Screws to handle the next enemy wave.

## Draft Priorities
- **Cookie generators**: [`Cookie Cutter`][card-cookie-cutter], [`Sugar Rush`][card-sugar-rush], [`Terminate`][card-terminate] (for mana-to-draw) keep the oven hot.
- **Screw spenders**: [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig], `Gauntlet`, [`Hammer Throw`][card-hammer-throw], [`Screwdriver`][card-screwdriver] handle defense/offense.
- **Resource boosters**: [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production], [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production], `Gear Up` supply extra Screws when cookies are scarce.
- **Core access**: [`Electrolysis`][card-electrolysis] or [`Potato`][card-potato] ensures you can pay cookie Core costs when needed.
- **Removals**: trim non-cookie attacks once the engine is online so every draw feeds the loop.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Sugar Rush`][card-sugar-rush] (more mana retention) and [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig]; follow with [`Hammer Throw`][card-hammer-throw] for bigger payoffs.
- **Hideout**: remove filler, Plan [`Cookie Cutter`][card-cookie-cutter], and invest gems until you snag [`Screw Making Mold`][card-screw-making-mold] or [`Battery Charger`][card-battery-charger].
- **Vaults**: comfortable once you have at least two cookie generators and Whirligig upgraded.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Party Hat`][card-party-hat] – perfect starter artifact; upgrades `Screw Shot` into `Piñata`/[`Sugar Rush`][card-sugar-rush] for extra cookies.
- [`Screw Making Mold`][card-screw-making-mold] – passive Screws keep Whirligig ready even on low-cookie hands.
- [`Battery Charger`][card-battery-charger] – +1 draw when holding a Core, handy for multi-cookie turns.
- [`Jack`][card-jack] – if you skip a turn (rare), it grants Screws + a Core to jump-start the engine again.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Play cookies first to gain Screws, then fire [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig] or [`Hammer Throw`][card-hammer-throw]; Screws spent on block shouldn’t leave you empty for upkeep.
- Use [`Sugar Rush`][card-sugar-rush] before ending turn; it prevents discard, letting you carry a hand of cookies into the next fight.
- Keep at least 4 Screws before enemy turns so upkeep traps or Whirligig can fire without leaving you vulnerable.
- Coordinate with allies—tell them when you’ll cast [`Terminate`][card-terminate] or [`Sugar Rush`][card-sugar-rush] so they don't overflow their hands.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Cookie Cutter`][card-cookie-cutter] ×2 | 1 | Cookie supply | Adds four cookies to draw pile; upgrade for more.
| [`Sugar Rush`][card-sugar-rush] | 1 | Mana/draw transfer | Uses all mana to feed allies and retain hand.
| `Cookie` (generated) | 0 | Screw gain | Spend with Core for mana + draw.
| [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig] | 0 | Team block | Converts Screws into party block.
| [`Hammer Throw`][card-hammer-throw] | 1 | Screw-based damage | Great for finishing packed lanes.
| [`Screwdriver`][card-screwdriver] | 1 | Stun | Uses Screws for unblockable hits on elites.
| [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] | 0 | Passive screws | Ensures upkeep when cookies are low.
| [`Electrolysis`][card-electrolysis] | 0 | Core generation | Converts Screws into Cores for cookie bonuses.
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Terminate`][card-terminate], `Gauntlet`, or trap support depending on drops.

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Hammer Throw`][card-hammer-throw] with 8 Screws deals 16 damage down the cone; enough for Act II elites.
- [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig] spends 6 Screws for 6 block (18 with Core) across the team, blanking most boss swings.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Feed allies mana/draw via [`Sugar Rush`][card-sugar-rush]; they can plan burst turns when you call out cookie windows.
- Against bosses, keep [`Whirligig`][card-whirligig] charged before thresholds; follow with [`Hammer Throw`][card-hammer-throw] to soften adds as they spawn.
- Coordinate with Rogue bomb players to push enemies into your Hammer Throw path.

## Common Pitfalls
- Burning Screws offensively and forgetting to save some for block—always end with a buffer.
- Not upgrading [`Sugar Rush`][card-sugar-rush]; without the upgrade, multi-cookie hands can clog.
- Skipping Core generation; without Cores, cookie bonuses are much weaker.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
