# Tinkerer Cookie Battery (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: loop `Sugar Rush`, `Cookie Cutter`, and `Cookie` summons to convert spare mana into Screws, then spend them on party-wide block with `Whirligig` or direct damage via `Hammer Throw`.
- **Difficulty**: Low (6/15) – very forgiving; as long as you keep baking cookies, the loop sustains the whole 12-floor run.
- **Best in**: backline support or mid slot; you feed mana/draw to allies while scaling Screws for defense or burst.
- **Key stats**: every `Cookie` grants 2 Screws (plus mana/draw when Core is used); two cycles per turn fuel `Whirligig` for 10+ block per hero.[1][2]

## Core Loop
1. Cast `Sugar Rush`/`Cookie Cutter` to add `Cookie` cards; play them to gain Screws, draw, and optionally mana.[1][2]
2. Convert Screws into block via `Whirligig`/`Gauntlet` or into damage with `Hammer Throw`/`Screwdriver`.[3][4]
3. Repeat each turn, ensuring you end with enough Screws to handle the next enemy wave.

## Draft Priorities
- **Cookie generators**: `Cookie Cutter`, `Sugar Rush`, `Terminate` (for mana-to-draw) keep the oven hot.[1][2][5]
- **Screw spenders**: `Whirligig`, `Gauntlet`, `Hammer Throw`, `Screwdriver` handle defense/offense.[3][4][6]
- **Resource boosters**: `Means of Production`, `Mass Production`, `Gear Up` supply extra Screws when cookies are scarce.[7][8]
- **Core access**: `Electrolysis` or `Potato` ensures you can pay cookie Core costs when needed.[9][10]
- **Removals**: trim non-cookie attacks once the engine is online so every draw feeds the loop.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Sugar Rush` (more mana retention) and `Whirligig`; follow with `Hammer Throw` for bigger payoffs.[1][3]
- **Hideout**: remove filler, Plan `Cookie Cutter`, and invest gems until you snag `Screw Making Mold` or `Battery Charger`.[11]
- **Vaults**: comfortable once you have at least two cookie generators and Whirligig upgraded.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Party Hat` – perfect starter artifact; upgrades `Screw Shot` into `Piñata`/`Sugar Rush` for extra cookies.[12]
- `Screw Making Mold` – passive Screws keep Whirligig ready even on low-cookie hands.[13]
- `Battery Charger` – +1 draw when holding a Core, handy for multi-cookie turns.[14]
- `Jack` – if you skip a turn (rare), it grants Screws + a Core to jump-start the engine again.[15]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Play cookies first to gain Screws, then fire `Whirligig` or `Hammer Throw`; Screws spent on block shouldn’t leave you empty for upkeep.[1][3]
- Use `Sugar Rush` before ending turn; it prevents discard, letting you carry a hand of cookies into the next fight.
- Keep at least 4 Screws before enemy turns so upkeep traps or Whirligig can fire without leaving you vulnerable.
- Coordinate with allies—tell them when you’ll cast `Terminate` or `Sugar Rush` so they don't overflow their hands.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Cookie Cutter` ×2 | 1 | Cookie supply | Adds four cookies to draw pile; upgrade for more.[1]
| `Sugar Rush` | 1 | Mana/draw transfer | Uses all mana to feed allies and retain hand.[2]
| `Cookie` (generated) | 0 | Screw gain | Spend with Core for mana + draw.[1]
| `Whirligig` | 0 | Team block | Converts Screws into party block.[3]
| `Hammer Throw` | 1 | Screw-based damage | Great for finishing packed lanes.[4]
| `Screwdriver` | 1 | Stun | Uses Screws for unblockable hits on elites.[6]
| `Means of Production` | 0 | Passive screws | Ensures upkeep when cookies are low.[7]
| `Electrolysis` | 0 | Core generation | Converts Screws into Cores for cookie bonuses.[9]
| Flex slot | — | Utility | `Terminate`, `Gauntlet`, or trap support depending on drops.[5][3]

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Hammer Throw` with 8 Screws deals 16 damage down the cone; enough for Act II elites.[4]
- `Whirligig` spends 6 Screws for 6 block (18 with Core) across the team, blanking most boss swings.[3]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Feed allies mana/draw via `Sugar Rush`; they can plan burst turns when you call out cookie windows.
- Against bosses, keep `Whirligig` charged before thresholds; follow with `Hammer Throw` to soften adds as they spawn.
- Coordinate with Rogue bomb players to push enemies into your Hammer Throw path.

## Common Pitfalls
- Burning Screws offensively and forgetting to save some for block—always end with a buffer.
- Not upgrading `Sugar Rush`; without the upgrade, multi-cookie hands can clog.
- Skipping Core generation; without Cores, cookie bonuses are much weaker.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
