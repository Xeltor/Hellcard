# Tinkerer Contraption Overdrive (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: spin up contraptions, hoard Screws, and chain activations (`Jump Start`, `Engage`, `Reuse`) until the board is blank.[1][2][3][4]
- **Difficulty**: High (12/15) – Screw/Core management is fussy, yet the contraption engine sustains damage through all 12 floors once assembled.
- **Best in**: back or mid slots; thrives in co-op where allies can protect the rig while it scales.
- **Key stats**: `Means of Production` + `Converter` generate 3–5 Screws per turn; spending a Core to double `Fire Sprinkler` or `Shoulder Cannon` turns into 20+ unblockable damage every enemy phase.[5][6][7]

## Core Loop
1. Build resource infrastructure with `Gear Up`, `Magnet`, `Means of Production`, and `Converter` to pump out Screws each turn.[5][6][8]
2. Deploy high-impact contraptions (`Fire Sprinkler`, `Shoulder Cannon`, `Pop-up Shield`) and feed them Cores via `Science!`, `Electrolysis`, or `Reuse`.[1][7][9]
3. Activate contraptions on demand using `Jump Start`, `Engage`, or `Reuse`; recycle spent machines with `Cannibalize`/`Redesign` to restock Screws and Cores for the next wave.[2][3][10][11]

## Draft Priorities
- **Resource engines**: `Magnet`, `Means of Production`, `Mass Production`, `Converter`; these keep Screw income steady.[5][6][12]
- **Core access**: `Science!` upgrades, `Electrolysis`, `Redesign`, `Reuse`. A steady 1–2 Cores lets you double the best contraptions.[1][9][11]
- **Contraption suite**: prioritize one unblockable damage option (`Fire Sprinkler`, `Shoulder Cannon`), one stun/control (`Flare`, `Illuminator`), and one defensive tool (`Pop-up Shield`, `Tough Tabard`).[7][13][14]
- **Activation tools**: `Jump Start` early; grab `Engage` or `Reuse` later for burst turns.[2][3]
- **Removals**: trim redundant starters (`Screw Shot`, extra `Gear Up`) once dedicated engines are online so you draw contraptions consistently.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Jump Start` (adds a draw), then `Magnet`/`Means of Production` to increase Screw flow; follow with key contraptions for damage scaling.[5][6][7]
- **Hideout**: remove dead cards, use **Plan** to pin `Means of Production` or `Science!`, and gift gems so the Tinkerer secures starter artifacts like `Transmission Belt` quickly.[15]
- **Vaults**: only once the engine exists; losing gems before buying Screw artifacts delays the loop considerably.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Transmission Belt` – draws whenever you re-trigger familiar contraptions, smoothing loop turns.[16]
- `Screw Making Mold` – 1–2 Screws per turn without spending cards is huge for scaling.[17]
- `Battery Charger` – +1 draw at the start of your turn when you hold a Core; great for setting up `Engage` turns.[18]
- `Party Hat` / `Work Glove` – upgrade starters into stronger contraptions (`Piñata`, `Fire Sprinkler`) without spending picks.[19][20]
- `Jack` – passively generates Screws + a Core on idle turns, excellent for recovery after boss phases.[21]
- Standard economy picks (`Silver Spoon`, `Clam`) remain worthwhile if you need extra gems for Armory routes.[22][23]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Play Screw generators before expensive activations; hitting 6+ Screws per turn lets you power Core modes every cycle.[5][6]
- `Jump Start` fires the first contraption – keep the highest-impact machine in slot one for emergency bursts.[2]
- Use `Reuse` to fire and cash in a contraption when you also need Cores; follow with `Prototype` or artifact-provided traps to fill the empty slot.[3][10]
- Remember some contraptions consume Screws/Cores when they trigger (`Fire Sprinkler`, `Shoulder Cannon`); ensure you end turns with enough Screws to pay the upkeep.[7][13]
- In co-op, announce when you’ll `Engage` so allies time buffs or stuns to maximize repeated triggers.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Screw/Core notes | Role | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Magnet` ×2 | 1 / Common | +2 Screws (double with Cores) | Resource engine | Reliable early Screw generation.[5] |
| `Means of Production` | 0 / Rare | Contraption, +1–2 Screws/turn | Passive economy | Leave at end of line for upkeep.[6] |
| `Mass Production` | 0 / Legendary | Contraption, +3 Screws (+2 if oom) | Passive economy | Core-increasing upkeep; worth it midgame.[12] |
| `Science!` | 1 / Starter | Gain 1 Core (Strains if already stocked) | Core ramp | Upgrade at Armory for consistency.[1] |
| `Electrolysis` | 0 / Rare | Trade 2 Screws → 1 Core | Core conversion | Keeps Cores flowing once Screws overflow.[9] |
| `Fire Sprinkler` | 0 / Common | Contraption, 2/6 unblockable cone | Damage | Maintain Screws/Cores for boosted mode.[7] |
| `Shoulder Cannon` or `Converter` | 0 / Rare | Contraption, splash or Screw gain | Damage / econ | Pick based on party needs (DPS vs resource).[13][24] |
| `Pop-up Shield` | 0 / Rare | Contraption, block each turn | Defense | Runs cheaply; great frontline insurance.[14] |
| `Jump Start` | 1 / Common | Instant activation | Control | Pairs with lethal contraptions for burst removal.[2] |
| `Engage` or `Reuse` | 2 / Legendary | Multi-activate / cash-out | Closer | Use when board is set for massive damage.[3][10] |
| Flex slot(s) | Varies | — | Utility | `Cannibalize`, `Redesign`, `Rapid Disassembly`, or scrolls depending on drop RNG.[11][25] |

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Fire Sprinkler`: 2 unblockable per trigger → 6 with Core; repeated via `Jump Start` or `Engage` wipes far lanes quickly.[7]
- `Shoulder Cannon`: 10 damage to two targets (20 with Core); combining with `Engage` yields 40+ damage per turn cycle.[13]
- `Mass Production` + `Converter`: 5–7 Screws each round; enough to afford `Spider Gun` or `Overpressure` upkeep without card investment.[12][24]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Feed early gems to secure Screw artifacts; once the machine is running, the Tinkerer becomes self-sufficient and feeds allies via stuns/control.
- Coordinate boss phases: hold `Engage` for add waves, and let allies body-block so you can stay in the back generating Cores.
- Against mobile bosses, use `Percussive Maintenance` or `Ribauldequin` for emergency stuns while contraptions spool up.[4]

## Common Pitfalls
- Letting Screws drop to zero when contraptions have upkeep – they’ll shut off or lose power the following turn.
- Spamming `Science!` without downtime; Strain ramps quickly if you already hold a Core.[1]
- Removing contraptions with `Cannibalize` or `Redesign` mid-boss without a replacement ready; always draft a backup before cashing out.[10][11]

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
