# Tinkerer Contraption Overdrive (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: spin up contraptions, hoard Screws, and chain activations ([`Jump Start`][card-jump-start], [`Engage`][card-engage], [`Reuse`][card-reuse]) until the board is blank.
- **Difficulty**: High (12/15) – Screw/Core management is fussy, yet the contraption engine sustains damage through all 12 floors once assembled.
- **Best in**: back or mid slots; thrives in co-op where allies can protect the rig while it scales.
- **Key stats**: [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] + [`Converter`][card-converter] generate 3–5 Screws per turn; spending a Core to double [`Fire Sprinkler`][card-fire-sprinkler] or [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon] turns into 20+ unblockable damage every enemy phase.

## Core Loop
1. Build resource infrastructure with [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up], [`Magnet`][card-magnet], [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production], and [`Converter`][card-converter] to pump out Screws each turn.
2. Deploy high-impact contraptions ([`Fire Sprinkler`][card-fire-sprinkler], [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon], [`Pop-up Shield`][card-pop-up-shield]) and feed them Cores via [`Science!`][card-science], [`Electrolysis`][card-electrolysis], or [`Reuse`][card-reuse].
3. Activate contraptions on demand using [`Jump Start`][card-jump-start], [`Engage`][card-engage], or [`Reuse`][card-reuse]; recycle spent machines with `Cannibalize`/[`Redesign`][card-redesign] to restock Screws and Cores for the next wave.

## Draft Priorities
- **Resource engines**: [`Magnet`][card-magnet], [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production], [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production], [`Converter`][card-converter]; these keep Screw income steady.
- **Core access**: [`Science!`][card-science] upgrades, [`Electrolysis`][card-electrolysis], [`Redesign`][card-redesign], [`Reuse`][card-reuse]. A steady 1–2 Cores lets you double the best contraptions.
- **Contraption suite**: prioritize one unblockable damage option ([`Fire Sprinkler`][card-fire-sprinkler], [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon]), one stun/control (`Flare`, `Illuminator`), and one defensive tool ([`Pop-up Shield`][card-pop-up-shield], `Tough Tabard`).
- **Activation tools**: [`Jump Start`][card-jump-start] early; grab [`Engage`][card-engage] or [`Reuse`][card-reuse] later for burst turns.
- **Removals**: trim redundant starters (`Screw Shot`, extra [`Gear Up`][card-gear-up]) once dedicated engines are online so you draw contraptions consistently.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Jump Start`][card-jump-start] (adds a draw), then [`Magnet`][card-magnet]/[`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] to increase Screw flow; follow with key contraptions for damage scaling.
- **Hideout**: remove dead cards, use **Plan** to pin [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] or [`Science!`][card-science], and gift gems so the Tinkerer secures starter artifacts like [`Transmission Belt`][card-transmission-belt] quickly.
- **Vaults**: only once the engine exists; losing gems before buying Screw artifacts delays the loop considerably.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Transmission Belt`][card-transmission-belt] – draws whenever you re-trigger familiar contraptions, smoothing loop turns.
- [`Screw Making Mold`][card-screw-making-mold] – 1–2 Screws per turn without spending cards is huge for scaling.
- [`Battery Charger`][card-battery-charger] – +1 draw at the start of your turn when you hold a Core; great for setting up [`Engage`][card-engage] turns.
- [`Party Hat`][card-party-hat] / [`Work Glove`][card-work-glove] – upgrade starters into stronger contraptions (`Piñata`, [`Fire Sprinkler`][card-fire-sprinkler]) without spending picks.
- [`Jack`][card-jack] – passively generates Screws + a Core on idle turns, excellent for recovery after boss phases.
- Standard economy picks ([`Silver Spoon`][card-silver-spoon], [`Clam`][card-clam]) remain worthwhile if you need extra gems for Armory routes.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Play Screw generators before expensive activations; hitting 6+ Screws per turn lets you power Core modes every cycle.
- [`Jump Start`][card-jump-start] fires the first contraption – keep the highest-impact machine in slot one for emergency bursts.
- Use [`Reuse`][card-reuse] to fire and cash in a contraption when you also need Cores; follow with `Prototype` or artifact-provided traps to fill the empty slot.
- Remember some contraptions consume Screws/Cores when they trigger ([`Fire Sprinkler`][card-fire-sprinkler], [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon]); ensure you end turns with enough Screws to pay the upkeep.
- In co-op, announce when you’ll [`Engage`][card-engage] so allies time buffs or stuns to maximize repeated triggers.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Screw/Core notes | Role | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Magnet`][card-magnet] ×2 | 1 / Common | +2 Screws (double with Cores) | Resource engine | Reliable early Screw generation. |
| [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] | 0 / Rare | Contraption, +1–2 Screws/turn | Passive economy | Leave at end of line for upkeep. |
| [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production] | 0 / Legendary | Contraption, +3 Screws (+2 if oom) | Passive economy | Core-increasing upkeep; worth it midgame. |
| [`Science!`][card-science] | 1 / Starter | Gain 1 Core (Strains if already stocked) | Core ramp | Upgrade at Armory for consistency. |
| [`Electrolysis`][card-electrolysis] | 0 / Rare | Trade 2 Screws → 1 Core | Core conversion | Keeps Cores flowing once Screws overflow. |
| [`Fire Sprinkler`][card-fire-sprinkler] | 0 / Common | Contraption, 2/6 unblockable cone | Damage | Maintain Screws/Cores for boosted mode. |
| [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon] or [`Converter`][card-converter] | 0 / Rare | Contraption, splash or Screw gain | Damage / econ | Pick based on party needs (DPS vs resource). |
| [`Pop-up Shield`][card-pop-up-shield] | 0 / Rare | Contraption, block each turn | Defense | Runs cheaply; great frontline insurance. |
| [`Jump Start`][card-jump-start] | 1 / Common | Instant activation | Control | Pairs with lethal contraptions for burst removal. |
| [`Engage`][card-engage] or [`Reuse`][card-reuse] | 2 / Legendary | Multi-activate / cash-out | Closer | Use when board is set for massive damage. |
| Flex slot(s) | Varies | — | Utility | `Cannibalize`, [`Redesign`][card-redesign], [`Rapid Disassembly`][card-rapid-disassembly], or scrolls depending on drop RNG. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Fire Sprinkler`][card-fire-sprinkler]: 2 unblockable per trigger → 6 with Core; repeated via [`Jump Start`][card-jump-start] or [`Engage`][card-engage] wipes far lanes quickly.
- [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon]: 10 damage to two targets (20 with Core); combining with [`Engage`][card-engage] yields 40+ damage per turn cycle.
- [`Mass Production`][card-mass-production] + [`Converter`][card-converter]: 5–7 Screws each round; enough to afford `Spider Gun` or `Overpressure` upkeep without card investment.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Feed early gems to secure Screw artifacts; once the machine is running, the Tinkerer becomes self-sufficient and feeds allies via stuns/control.
- Coordinate boss phases: hold [`Engage`][card-engage] for add waves, and let allies body-block so you can stay in the back generating Cores.
- Against mobile bosses, use [`Percussive Maintenance`][card-percussive-maintenance] or `Ribauldequin` for emergency stuns while contraptions spool up.

## Common Pitfalls
- Letting Screws drop to zero when contraptions have upkeep – they’ll shut off or lose power the following turn.
- Spamming [`Science!`][card-science] without downtime; Strain ramps quickly if you already hold a Core.
- Removing contraptions with `Cannibalize` or [`Redesign`][card-redesign] mid-boss without a replacement ready; always draft a backup before cashing out.
