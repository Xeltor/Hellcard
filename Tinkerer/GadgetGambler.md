# Tinkerer Gadget Gambler (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: leverage random gadget generation from [`Junk Drawer`][card-junk-drawer], [`Rolodex`][card-rolodex], and [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production], cycling results with [`Bespoke`][card-bespoke]/[`Hidden Variable`][card-hidden-variable] until you hit high-impact devices.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (11/15) – demands flexible decision-making and adapts to whatever tools appear.
- **Best in**: co-op support; feeds allies situational gadgets while contributing burst damage when RNG cooperates.
- **Key stats**: [`Junk Drawer`][card-junk-drawer] adds two random gadgets, and [`Bespoke`][card-bespoke] refunds mana when you discard them for better picks.

## Core Loop
1. Generate gadgets each turn using [`Junk Drawer`][card-junk-drawer], [`Rolodex`][card-rolodex], [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production], and [`Idea`][card-idea].
2. Reroll unwanted options via [`Bespoke`][card-bespoke], [`Hidden Variable`][card-hidden-variable], and [`Redesign`][card-redesign] until you assemble a strong hand.
3. Deploy the best finds ([`Ribauldequin`][card-ribauldequin], `Compact Catapult`, [`Pop-up Shield`][card-pop-up-shield]) and repeat the cycle.

## Draft Priorities
- **Generation**: [`Junk Drawer`][card-junk-drawer], [`Rolodex`][card-rolodex], [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production], [`Idea`][card-idea]; upgrade Junk Drawer first.
- **Filter tools**: [`Bespoke`][card-bespoke], [`Hidden Variable`][card-hidden-variable], [`Redesign`][card-redesign], [`Quantum Flow`][card-quantum-flow] keep results relevant.
- **Safety net**: [`Pop-up Shield`][card-pop-up-shield], [`Field Repairs`][card-field-repairs], [`Organize`][card-organize] ensure you survive bad rolls.
- **Removals**: cut rigid bombs; the deck thrives on flexible gadget slots.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Junk Drawer`][card-junk-drawer], then [`Bespoke`][card-bespoke]; [`Hidden Variable`][card-hidden-variable] third for better redraws.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Junk Drawer`][card-junk-drawer], remove fixed-damage cards, invest gems into artifacts that add more gadgets ([`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production], [`Battery`][card-battery]).
- **Vaults**: worth visiting; legendary gadgets drastically raise ceiling.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] – baseline gadget every turn fuels the engine.
- [`Battery`][card-battery] – mana refunds when you deploy multiple devices in one turn.
- [`Quicksort`][card-quicksort] – top-decks the best gadget draws for consistency.
- [`Solidarity`][card-solidarity] – allies gain block when you play gadgets, helping co-op teams.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Generate first, filter second: play [`Junk Drawer`][card-junk-drawer]/[`Rolodex`][card-rolodex] before [`Bespoke`][card-bespoke] so you know what to ditch.
- [`Hidden Variable`][card-hidden-variable] transforms unwanted gadgets—use it on low-impact traps or shields.
- Always keep one defensive gadget in hand for emergencies; RNG can whiff on block tools.
- Co-op: announce interesting gadgets (e.g., `Tabletop Trebuchet`) so allies plan around them.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Junk Drawer`][card-junk-drawer] ×2 | 1 / Common | Gadget generation | Upgrade for extra gadget + draw. |
| [`Rolodex`][card-rolodex] | 0 / Rare | Discover gadget | Filters options quickly. |
| [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] | 1 / Rare | Passive gadget | Core engine piece. |
| [`Idea`][card-idea] | 0 / Common | Random device | Free roll each turn. |
| [`Bespoke`][card-bespoke] ×2 | 0 / Rare | Reroll | Converts junk into the gadget you need. |
| [`Hidden Variable`][card-hidden-variable] | 0 / Rare | Transform | Reforges weak finds. |
| [`Redesign`][card-redesign] | 1 / Rare | Upgrade reroll | Great when you find duplicates. |
| [`Pop-up Shield`][card-pop-up-shield] | 0 / Common | Defense | Cheap insurance while gambling. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Quantum Flow`][card-quantum-flow], [`Field Repairs`][card-field-repairs], or artifact gadgets as needed. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] + [`Junk Drawer`][card-junk-drawer] reliably produce 3 gadgets/turn; expect one high-impact device every cycle.
- [`Bespoke`][card-bespoke] → `Compact Catapult` swings for 8 damage while repositioning enemies.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Share defensive gadgets with allies; [`Solidarity`][card-solidarity] artifact turns them into team-wide block.
- Save rerolls for boss phases—fishing for [`Ribauldequin`][card-ribauldequin] or `Overpressure` is worth the mana.
- Call out when RNG bricked so allies cover offense/defense that turn.

## Common Pitfalls
- Playing rerolls before generating new gadgets wastes value.
- Holding unusable gadgets—dump them via [`Bespoke`][card-bespoke] to dig deeper.
- Forgetting to include defense; RNG won’t always hand you shields.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
