# Tinkerer Rocket Relay Gunner (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: chain artillery deployables—[`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon], [`Backpack Ballista`][card-backpack-ballista], [`Tabletop Trebuchet`][card-tabletop-trebuchet]—to bombard lanes while [`Overpressure`][card-overpressure] and `Boom Bird` clean up stragglers.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (10/15) – relies on rares and positioning but has a forgiving learning curve once set up.
- **Best in**: backline solo or co-op; wants allies to hold enemies still while the guns charge.
- **Key stats**: upgraded [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon] fires every turn for 5 damage, and [`Backpack Ballista`][card-backpack-ballista] adds 3 damage per shot while reducing enemy armor.

## Core Loop
1. Deploy static weapons early ([`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon], [`Tabletop Trebuchet`][card-tabletop-trebuchet], [`Backpack Ballista`][card-backpack-ballista]).
2. Feed them charges with [`Overpressure`][card-overpressure], [`Compact Catapult`][card-compact-catapult], and [`Power Drill`][card-power-drill] pulls to keep enemies in range.
3. Finish waves using `Boom Bird` or [`Ribauldequin`][card-ribauldequin] when artillery cooldowns align.

## Draft Priorities
- **Deployables**: prioritize [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon], [`Backpack Ballista`][card-backpack-ballista], [`Tabletop Trebuchet`][card-tabletop-trebuchet]; upgrade Cannon first.
- **Support**: [`Overpressure`][card-overpressure], [`Compact Catapult`][card-compact-catapult], [`Duct Tape`][card-duct-tape] extend deployable uptime and reposition enemies.
- **Defense**: [`Pop-up Shield`][card-pop-up-shield], [`Pavise`][card-pavise], [`Field Repairs`][card-field-repairs] ensure survival while weapons arm.
- **Removals**: trim melee tools; you win from range.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon] → [`Backpack Ballista`][card-backpack-ballista] → [`Tabletop Trebuchet`][card-tabletop-trebuchet] upgrade path.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon], remove redundant traps, and invest gems into artifacts that add charges ([`Capacitor`][card-capacitor], [`Battery`][card-battery]).
- **Vaults**: excellent—legendary artillery (e.g., `Backpack Ballista+`) skyrockets DPS.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Capacitor`][card-capacitor] – extra charges for artillery each round.
- [`Battery`][card-battery] – refunds mana after playing devices, keeping turns smooth.
- [`Means of Production`][card-means-of-production] – adds free deployables when you craft more machines.
- [`Tough Tabard`][card-tough-tabard] – defensive buffer to survive while cannons spin up.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Play [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon] turn one whenever possible; its damage compounds over time.
- Use [`Compact Catapult`][card-compact-catapult] to push enemies into artillery lanes instead of chasing them.
- Refresh [`Overpressure`][card-overpressure] before big waves—double-shot turns often win fights.
- Co-op: let allies know where turrets point so they herd enemies accordingly.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon] ×2 | 2 / Rare | Core DPS | Upgrade for reduced cooldown. |
| [`Backpack Ballista`][card-backpack-ballista] | 2 / Rare | Armor shred | Great vs bosses. |
| [`Tabletop Trebuchet`][card-tabletop-trebuchet] | 1 / Rare | Long-range AOE | Clear far lanes safely. |
| [`Overpressure`][card-overpressure] | 1 / Rare | Charge boost | Readies artillery instantly. |
| [`Compact Catapult`][card-compact-catapult] | 0 / Rare | Reposition | Aligns cones with artillery. |
| [`Power Drill`][card-power-drill] | 1 / Rare | Pull | Keeps enemies in kill zones. |
| `Boom Bird` | 1 / Rare | Burst | Detonates for emergency clears. |
| [`Pop-up Shield`][card-pop-up-shield] | 0 / Common | Defense | Cheap block while waiting. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Pavise`][card-pavise], [`Field Repairs`][card-field-repairs], or artifact devices for sustain. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Shoulder Cannon`][card-shoulder-cannon] + [`Overpressure`][card-overpressure] fires twice for 10 damage per turn by Act II.
- [`Backpack Ballista`][card-backpack-ballista] + [`Tabletop Trebuchet`][card-tabletop-trebuchet] clears 15 HP waves when both lined up.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Boss fights: drop artillery in safe lanes and use [`Power Drill`][card-power-drill] to keep them pinned.
- Share defensive gadgets with allies ([`Pop-up Shield`][card-pop-up-shield]) when aggro shifts.
- Coordinate with Warriors for pushes that land enemies in trebuchet arcs.

## Common Pitfalls
- Deploying artillery too late; these cards need time to tick.
- Forgetting to protect devices—use [`Duct Tape`][card-duct-tape] if enemies start targeting them.
- Running out of defense; add [`Field Repairs`][card-field-repairs] or [`Pavise`][card-pavise] to cover downtime.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
