# Mage Chain Lightning Cascade (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Medium (9/15) – straightforward bolt sequencing, but maintaining mana and avoiding Strain across 12 floors takes pacing.
- **Win condition**: loop lightning bolts (`Lightning`, `Zap`, `Harpoon Bolt`, `Bolt Hell`) while stacking bolt bonuses from `Bolt Dance` and `Hearteater Bolt`.
- **Best in**: backline DPS; ideal when the team needs consistent AOE that doesn’t rely on freeze.
- **Key stats**: `Lightning` + `Bolt Dance` grants 4–5 damage splash per cast; `Hearteater Bolt` increases damage after every elite kill, scaling the build into Act III.

## Core Loop
1. Use `Lightning` and `Zap` to clear grouped enemies, leveraging chain hits to soften the board.[1][2]
2. Secure kills with `Harpoon Bolt`, `Sucker Bolt`, and `Bat Bolt` to refund mana, draw cards, and gain healing.[3][4][5]
3. Stack bonuses from `Bolt Dance`, `Hearteater Bolt`, and `Power is Knowledge` to keep bolts coming and damage rising.[6][7][8]

## Draft Priorities
- **Bolt core**: `Lightning`, `Zap`, `Harpoon Bolt`, `Sucker Bolt`; upgrade them early for damage/mana efficiency.[1][2][3][4]
- **Scaling**: `Bolt Dance`, `Hearteater Bolt`, `Bolt Hell` exponentially increase multi-hit damage.[6][7][9]
- **Sustain**: `Bat Bolt` (heal on kill) and `Volcanic Lightning` (high single-target damage) keep you healthy and relevant against elites.[5][10]
- **Utility**: `Weave Laylines` remains a 0-cost reset button; `Scroll` package or `Weave Laylines` picks are optional if offered.[8]
- **Removals**: drop non-bolt spells once engine is online to avoid diluting your draw.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Lightning` and `Harpoon Bolt` first; follow with `Zap` to increase chain damage.[1][2][3]
- **Hideout**: remove redundant spells, Plan `Lightning`, and invest gems until you can buy bolt artifacts (`Bolt Amplifier` equivalents like `Power is Knowledge`).[11]
- **Vaults**: safe once your bolt suite is assembled; take them for extra artifacts (e.g., `Tiny Capacitor` if found).

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Power is Knowledge` (if offered as artifact via events) doubles down on kill-based scroll/bolt rewards.[8]
- `Spacious Sleeve` and `Transmission Belt` help with draw if you weave in scrolls; otherwise favor mana-increasing relics (`Silver Spoon`, `Fruits of Labor`).[12][13]
- `Acorn` isn’t class-locked; provides block for taking chip damage between bolt bursts.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Lead with `Lightning` to chip multiple enemies, then `Harpoon Bolt` the lowest HP for mana/draw refunds.[1][3]
- Use `Bolt Dance` once you have multiple bolts in hand; every cast afterwards hits harder until the buff expires.[6]
- `Hearteater Bolt` stores Strength from slain monsters; plan to finish high-Strength foes with it for bigger future hits.[7]
- Watch Strain on `Lightning`/`Zap`; alternate with cheaper bolts (`Sucker Bolt`, `Bat Bolt`) to reset mana usage.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Study | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Lightning` ×2 | 2 / Common | Chain damage | Upgrade for higher splash; manage Strain.[1]
| `Zap` | 2 / Rare | Board sweep | Follows Lightning to mop up stragglers.[2]
| `Harpoon Bolt` | 1 / Rare | Mana/draw refund | Kill to keep mana topped off.[3]
| `Sucker Bolt` | 1 / Common | Refund bolt | Cheap cleanup tool that pays for itself.[4]
| `Bat Bolt` | 1 / Rare | Sustain | Heals on kill, perfect for long fights.[5]
| `Bolt Dance` | 2 / Rare | Damage scaling | Apply before casting multiple bolts.[6]
| `Hearteater Bolt` | 1 / Legendary | Scaling finisher | Ramps damage with each Strength-kill.[7]
| `Bolt Hell` | 1 / Legendary | AOE payoff | Gains cards/heals on multi-kills.[9]
| Flex slots | — | Utility | `Volcanic Lightning`, `Weave Laylines`, or scroll support depending on drops.[8][10]

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Lightning` base hits for 3 + 1 splash; with `Bolt Dance` it rises to 4/2, enough to clear Act II trash quickly.[1][6]
- `Hearteater Bolt` storing 5 Strength boosts every subsequent bolt by 5—stack it for bosses.[7]
- `Bolt Hell` can trigger multiple draws/heals in one cast if you line up low-HP enemies.[9]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Communicate kill targets so you secure mana refunds; allies can leave softened enemies for your finishing bolts.
- During boss adds, open with `Lightning`/`Zap` to soften the board, then use `Bolt Hell` for instant cleanup.
- Keep an emergency bolt (`Bat Bolt` or `Harpoon Bolt`) for executing shielded elites when `Power is Knowledge` is active.

## Common Pitfalls
- Spamming `Lightning` without watching Strain; rotate bolts to avoid mana droughts mid-floor.
- Overlooking sustain—always pack `Bat Bolt` or healing artifacts to survive chip damage.
- Failing to upgrade early; un-upgraded bolts struggle in Act III, hurting 12-floor consistency.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
