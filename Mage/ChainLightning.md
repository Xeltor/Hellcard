# Mage Chain Lightning Cascade (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Medium (9/15) – straightforward bolt sequencing, but maintaining mana and avoiding Strain across 12 floors takes pacing.
- **Win condition**: loop lightning bolts ([`Lightning`][card-lightning], [`Zap`][card-zap], [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt], [`Bolt Hell`][card-bolt-hell]) while stacking bolt bonuses from [`Bolt Dance`][card-bolt-dance] and [`Hearteater Bolt`][card-hearteater-bolt].
- **Best in**: backline DPS; ideal when the team needs consistent AOE that doesn’t rely on freeze.
- **Key stats**: [`Lightning`][card-lightning] + [`Bolt Dance`][card-bolt-dance] grants 4–5 damage splash per cast; [`Hearteater Bolt`][card-hearteater-bolt] increases damage after every elite kill, scaling the build into Act III.

## Core Loop
1. Use [`Lightning`][card-lightning] and [`Zap`][card-zap] to clear grouped enemies, leveraging chain hits to soften the board.
2. Secure kills with [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt], [`Sucker Bolt`][card-sucker-bolt], and [`Bat Bolt`][card-bat-bolt] to refund mana, draw cards, and gain healing.
3. Stack bonuses from [`Bolt Dance`][card-bolt-dance], [`Hearteater Bolt`][card-hearteater-bolt], and [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge] to keep bolts coming and damage rising.

## Draft Priorities
- **Bolt core**: [`Lightning`][card-lightning], [`Zap`][card-zap], [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt], [`Sucker Bolt`][card-sucker-bolt]; upgrade them early for damage/mana efficiency.
- **Scaling**: [`Bolt Dance`][card-bolt-dance], [`Hearteater Bolt`][card-hearteater-bolt], [`Bolt Hell`][card-bolt-hell] exponentially increase multi-hit damage.
- **Sustain**: [`Bat Bolt`][card-bat-bolt] (heal on kill) and [`Volcanic Lightning`][card-volcanic-lightning] (high single-target damage) keep you healthy and relevant against elites.
- **Utility**: `Weave Laylines` remains a 0-cost reset button; `Scroll` package or `Weave Laylines` picks are optional if offered.
- **Removals**: drop non-bolt spells once engine is online to avoid diluting your draw.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Lightning`][card-lightning] and [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] first; follow with [`Zap`][card-zap] to increase chain damage.
- **Hideout**: remove redundant spells, Plan [`Lightning`][card-lightning], and invest gems until you can buy bolt artifacts (`Bolt Amplifier` equivalents like [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge]).
- **Vaults**: safe once your bolt suite is assembled; take them for extra artifacts (e.g., `Tiny Capacitor` if found).

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge] (if offered as artifact via events) doubles down on kill-based scroll/bolt rewards.
- [`Spacious Sleeve`][card-spacious-sleeve] and `Transmission Belt` help with draw if you weave in scrolls; otherwise favor mana-increasing relics ([`Silver Spoon`][card-silver-spoon], `Fruits of Labor`).
- `Acorn` isn’t class-locked; provides block for taking chip damage between bolt bursts.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Lead with [`Lightning`][card-lightning] to chip multiple enemies, then [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] the lowest HP for mana/draw refunds.
- Use [`Bolt Dance`][card-bolt-dance] once you have multiple bolts in hand; every cast afterwards hits harder until the buff expires.
- [`Hearteater Bolt`][card-hearteater-bolt] stores Strength from slain monsters; plan to finish high-Strength foes with it for bigger future hits.
- Watch Strain on [`Lightning`][card-lightning]/[`Zap`][card-zap]; alternate with cheaper bolts ([`Sucker Bolt`][card-sucker-bolt], [`Bat Bolt`][card-bat-bolt]) to reset mana usage.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Study | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Lightning`][card-lightning] ×2 | 2 / Common | Chain damage | Upgrade for higher splash; manage Strain.
| [`Zap`][card-zap] | 2 / Rare | Board sweep | Follows Lightning to mop up stragglers.
| [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] | 1 / Rare | Mana/draw refund | Kill to keep mana topped off.
| [`Sucker Bolt`][card-sucker-bolt] | 1 / Common | Refund bolt | Cheap cleanup tool that pays for itself.
| [`Bat Bolt`][card-bat-bolt] | 1 / Rare | Sustain | Heals on kill, perfect for long fights.
| [`Bolt Dance`][card-bolt-dance] | 2 / Rare | Damage scaling | Apply before casting multiple bolts.
| [`Hearteater Bolt`][card-hearteater-bolt] | 1 / Legendary | Scaling finisher | Ramps damage with each Strength-kill.
| [`Bolt Hell`][card-bolt-hell] | 1 / Legendary | AOE payoff | Gains cards/heals on multi-kills.
| Flex slots | — | Utility | [`Volcanic Lightning`][card-volcanic-lightning], `Weave Laylines`, or scroll support depending on drops.

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Lightning`][card-lightning] base hits for 3 + 1 splash; with [`Bolt Dance`][card-bolt-dance] it rises to 4/2, enough to clear Act II trash quickly.
- [`Hearteater Bolt`][card-hearteater-bolt] storing 5 Strength boosts every subsequent bolt by 5—stack it for bosses.
- [`Bolt Hell`][card-bolt-hell] can trigger multiple draws/heals in one cast if you line up low-HP enemies.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Communicate kill targets so you secure mana refunds; allies can leave softened enemies for your finishing bolts.
- During boss adds, open with [`Lightning`][card-lightning]/[`Zap`][card-zap] to soften the board, then use [`Bolt Hell`][card-bolt-hell] for instant cleanup.
- Keep an emergency bolt ([`Bat Bolt`][card-bat-bolt] or [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt]) for executing shielded elites when [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge] is active.

## Common Pitfalls
- Spamming [`Lightning`][card-lightning] without watching Strain; rotate bolts to avoid mana droughts mid-floor.
- Overlooking sustain—always pack [`Bat Bolt`][card-bat-bolt] or healing artifacts to survive chip damage.
- Failing to upgrade early; un-upgraded bolts struggle in Act III, hurting 12-floor consistency.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
