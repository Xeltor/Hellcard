# Mage Scroll Cartomancer (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Low (7/15) – simple scroll sequencing keeps mana/block flowing through the 12-floor campaign with minimal risk.
- **Win condition**: churn scrolls (`Unpack the Bag`, `Rewrite`, `Paper Library`) to flood the party with mana, block, and draw while opportunistically killing with bolts.[1][2][3][4]
- **Best in**: backline support in co-op or control-focused solo runs.
- **Key stats**: each scroll cycle gives 1 mana, 1 card, and 5 block; with `Power is Knowledge` active you generate scrolls off every kill, sustaining the engine indefinitely.

## Core Loop
1. Cast `Unpack the Bag`/`Paper Library` to add scrolls, then use them immediately for mana, draw, and block as the situation demands.[1][3]
2. Keep `Rewrite` and `Power is Knowledge` active to duplicate scrolls and trigger extra when enemies die.[2][4]
3. Spend spare mana on bolts (`Harpoon Bolt`, `Lightning`) or team control while scrolls refill resources each turn.

## Draft Priorities
- **Scroll sources**: `Unpack the Bag`, `Paper Library`, `Rewrite`—take every copy offered.[1][2][3]
- **Payoffs**: `Power is Knowledge`, `Paper Recycle`, `Bolt Dance` convert kills into more scrolls/bolt damage.[4][5][6]
- **Damage**: `Harpoon Bolt`, `Lightning`, `Fractal Whip` ensure you can secure kills to trigger scroll relics.[7][8]
- **Utility**: `Weave Laylines` still excellent, `Arcane Arsenal` or `Volcanic Lightning` for direct damage waves.[9]
- **Removals**: trim slow setup cards once scroll density is high; aim to cycle into scrolls every turn.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Unpack the Bag` (more scrolls) and `Harpoon Bolt` for reliable kills; follow with `Lightning` or `Fractal Whip` as needed.[1][7][8]
- **Hideout**: remove dead cards, Plan `Unpack the Bag`, and invest gems until you can buy scroll artifacts like `Spacious Sleeve`.[10]
- **Vaults**: only if scroll engine already online; otherwise focus on Armory/Hideout to secure core pieces.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Spacious Sleeve` – start each turn with a scroll, guaranteeing engine uptime.[11]
- `Paper Clip` (if found) or `Transmission Belt` equivalents keep hand size up when spamming scrolls.
- `Silver Spoon`/`Clam` stay valuable for early upgrades to maximize kill-secured scrolls.[12][13]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Play `Rewrite` before spending scrolls so duplicates are added at current stack counts.[2]
- Use `Scroll of Mind` for mana when hand is heavy; follow with `Scroll of Wisdom` to dig for kill cards.[1]
- Save `Scroll of Wall` for elite/boss hits; with duplication you can layer 10+ block between turns.
- When `Power is Knowledge` is active, ensure you land the killing blow to trigger extra scrolls—communicate with allies in co-op.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Study | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Unpack the Bag` ×2 | 1 / Common | – | Scroll supply | Always keep at least one in hand.[1]
| `Rewrite` | 1 / Rare | – | Scroll duplication | Double scroll stacks before spending.[2]
| `Paper Library` | 1 / Legendary | – | Scroll burst | Great for elite prep; Strain mindful of cooldown.[3]
| `Power is Knowledge` | 1 / Rare | – | Kill trigger | Scrolls per kill; time bolt hits carefully.[4]
| `Paper Recycle` | 1 / Legendary | – | Bolt/scroll hybrid | Adds scroll + bolt on kills, fueling loops.[5]
| `Harpoon Bolt` | 1 / Rare | – | Damage + refund | Secures kills to trigger scroll effects.[7]
| `Lightning` | 2 / Common | – | Sweep | Efficient with extra mana from scrolls.[8]
| `Weave Laylines` | 0 / Legendary | – | Team battery | Still a fantastic panic button.[9]
| Flex slots | — | – | Utility | `Fractal Whip`, `Volcanic Lightning`, or defensive spells depending on drops.

## Damage Benchmarks
- Scroll engine yields 3 scrolls/turn midrun → 3 mana + 3 card draw + 15 block for the team.
- `Harpoon Bolt` kill + `Power is Knowledge` = another scroll; chain with `Paper Recycle` for bolt + scroll double rewards.[4][5]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Call out when you’re duplicating scrolls so allies wait to draw before you fire `Scroll of Mind`/`Scroll of Wisdom`.
- Keep `Scroll of Wall` for thresholds; layered block prevents chip damage while bolts finish minions.
- For bosses, hold `Paper Library` until adds spawn—dropping multiple scrolls ensures the team has mana/block for emergencies.

## Common Pitfalls
- Burning scrolls without `Rewrite` active—always duplicate first when possible.
- Forgetting Strain on `Paper Library`; plan turns so you aren’t overloading when it’s exhausted.
- Letting allies take kill shots when `Power is Knowledge` is up; coordinate so you trigger the bonuses.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
