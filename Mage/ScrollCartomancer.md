# Mage Scroll Cartomancer (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Difficulty**: Low (7/15) – simple scroll sequencing keeps mana/block flowing through the 12-floor campaign with minimal risk.
- **Win condition**: churn scrolls ([`Unpack the Bag`][card-unpack-the-bag], [`Rewrite`][card-rewrite], [`Paper Library`][card-paper-library]) to flood the party with mana, block, and draw while opportunistically killing with bolts.
- **Best in**: backline support in co-op or control-focused solo runs.
- **Key stats**: each scroll cycle gives 1 mana, 1 card, and 5 block; with [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge] active you generate scrolls off every kill, sustaining the engine indefinitely.

## Core Loop
1. Cast [`Unpack the Bag`][card-unpack-the-bag]/[`Paper Library`][card-paper-library] to add scrolls, then use them immediately for mana, draw, and block as the situation demands.
2. Keep [`Rewrite`][card-rewrite] and [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge] active to duplicate scrolls and trigger extra when enemies die.
3. Spend spare mana on bolts ([`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt], [`Lightning`][card-lightning]) or team control while scrolls refill resources each turn.

## Draft Priorities
- **Scroll sources**: [`Unpack the Bag`][card-unpack-the-bag], [`Paper Library`][card-paper-library], [`Rewrite`][card-rewrite]—take every copy offered.
- **Payoffs**: [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge], [`Paper Recycle`][card-paper-recycle], [`Bolt Dance`][card-bolt-dance] convert kills into more scrolls/bolt damage.
- **Damage**: [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt], [`Lightning`][card-lightning], `Fractal Whip` ensure you can secure kills to trigger scroll relics.
- **Utility**: [`Weave Laylines`][card-weave-laylines] still excellent, `Arcane Arsenal` or `Volcanic Lightning` for direct damage waves.
- **Removals**: trim slow setup cards once scroll density is high; aim to cycle into scrolls every turn.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Unpack the Bag`][card-unpack-the-bag] (more scrolls) and [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] for reliable kills; follow with [`Lightning`][card-lightning] or `Fractal Whip` as needed.
- **Hideout**: remove dead cards, Plan [`Unpack the Bag`][card-unpack-the-bag], and invest gems until you can buy scroll artifacts like [`Spacious Sleeve`][card-spacious-sleeve].
- **Vaults**: only if scroll engine already online; otherwise focus on Armory/Hideout to secure core pieces.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Spacious Sleeve`][card-spacious-sleeve] – start each turn with a scroll, guaranteeing engine uptime.
- `Paper Clip` (if found) or `Transmission Belt` equivalents keep hand size up when spamming scrolls.
- [`Silver Spoon`][card-silver-spoon]/[`Clam`][card-clam] stay valuable for early upgrades to maximize kill-secured scrolls.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Play [`Rewrite`][card-rewrite] before spending scrolls so duplicates are added at current stack counts.
- Use `Scroll of Mind` for mana when hand is heavy; follow with `Scroll of Wisdom` to dig for kill cards.
- Save `Scroll of Wall` for elite/boss hits; with duplication you can layer 10+ block between turns.
- When [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge] is active, ensure you land the killing blow to trigger extra scrolls—communicate with allies in co-op.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Study | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Unpack the Bag`][card-unpack-the-bag] ×2 | 1 / Common | – | Scroll supply | Always keep at least one in hand.
| [`Rewrite`][card-rewrite] | 1 / Rare | – | Scroll duplication | Double scroll stacks before spending.
| [`Paper Library`][card-paper-library] | 1 / Legendary | – | Scroll burst | Great for elite prep; Strain mindful of cooldown.
| [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge] | 1 / Rare | – | Kill trigger | Scrolls per kill; time bolt hits carefully.
| [`Paper Recycle`][card-paper-recycle] | 1 / Legendary | – | Bolt/scroll hybrid | Adds scroll + bolt on kills, fueling loops.
| [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] | 1 / Rare | – | Damage + refund | Secures kills to trigger scroll effects.
| [`Lightning`][card-lightning] | 2 / Common | – | Sweep | Efficient with extra mana from scrolls.
| [`Weave Laylines`][card-weave-laylines] | 0 / Legendary | – | Team battery | Still a fantastic panic button.
| Flex slots | — | – | Utility | `Fractal Whip`, `Volcanic Lightning`, or defensive spells depending on drops.

## Damage Benchmarks
- Scroll engine yields 3 scrolls/turn midrun → 3 mana + 3 card draw + 15 block for the team.
- [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] kill + [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge] = another scroll; chain with [`Paper Recycle`][card-paper-recycle] for bolt + scroll double rewards.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Call out when you’re duplicating scrolls so allies wait to draw before you fire `Scroll of Mind`/`Scroll of Wisdom`.
- Keep `Scroll of Wall` for thresholds; layered block prevents chip damage while bolts finish minions.
- For bosses, hold [`Paper Library`][card-paper-library] until adds spawn—dropping multiple scrolls ensures the team has mana/block for emergencies.

## Common Pitfalls
- Burning scrolls without [`Rewrite`][card-rewrite] active—always duplicate first when possible.
- Forgetting Strain on [`Paper Library`][card-paper-library]; plan turns so you aren’t overloading when it’s exhausted.
- Letting allies take kill shots when [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge] is up; coordinate so you trigger the bonuses.
