# Mage Snowball Bolt Battery (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: freeze priority enemies, then double bolt damage with [`Snowball`][card-snowball]/[`Subzero`][card-subzero] while recycling mana through [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] kills.
- **Difficulty**: High (12/15) – relies on key legendaries and precise sequencing to secure the full 12-floor clear.
- **Best in**: mid/back row in solo or co-op; shines at clearing wide boards while feeding allies mana and cards.
- **Key stats**: a frozen target turns [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] into a 1-mana payoff that refunds mana + party draw; [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip] drops to 0-cost after two kills, letting you chain bursts.

## Core Loop
1. Apply freeze with [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm]/[`Rune of Ice`][card-rune-of-ice] and bank the debuff using minimal mana.
2. Drop [`Snowball`][card-snowball] (or [`Subzero`][card-subzero]) so bolts deal 2× damage into frozen targets, then fire [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] and [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip] for efficient clears.
3. Use the mana/card refunds from [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] and [`Weave Laylines`][card-weave-laylines] to reset your hand, repeat freezes, and keep the team topped off.

## Draft Priorities
- **Freeze sources**: [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm] → [`Rune of Ice`][card-rune-of-ice] → [`Chilly Blow`][card-chilly-blow]; take [`Eternal Winter`][card-eternal-winter] later as an emergency panic button.
- **Bolt payoffs**: [`Snowball`][card-snowball] is mandatory; add [`Subzero`][card-subzero] for scaling and [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] for refunds.
- **Sustain tools**: [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip] for cycling damage and [`Weave Laylines`][card-weave-laylines] for 0-cost team refuel.
- **Utility**: pick up one large AOE ([`Zap`][card-zap]) for unfrozen trash and consider `Brutal Thaw` from artifacts to capitalize on freeze explosions.
- **Removals**: trim starting `Magic Bolt` once you have better bolt density to avoid whiff draws.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: first upgrade goes to [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] (increases damage to secure kills) or [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip] (drops kill threshold for the cost reduction).
- **Hideout**: remove filler, use **Plan** to pin [`Snowball`][card-snowball] or [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm], and gift spare gems if the Mage is carrying Snowball scaling alone.
- **Vaults**: only detour once [`Snowball`][card-snowball] is online; losing gem tempo early delays the influence purchase that makes the build work.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Hat`][card-hat] – cheaply adds [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip], giving you a dependable bolt payoff.
- [`Cockade`][card-cockade] – injects [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm] and `Brutal Thaw`, covering both freeze application and detonation.
- [`Acorn`][card-acorn] – rewards triple-bolt turns with 10 block, protecting the Mage while combos loop.
- [`Silver Spoon`][card-silver-spoon] / [`Clam`][card-clam] – early gem economy still matters; grab one to fund upgrades and influence purchases.
- Support relics like `Spacious Sleeve` or `Little Helper` are optional; use them if you need extra scroll/card flow but prioritise freeze/burst artifacts first.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Cast freeze before [`Snowball`][card-snowball]; the influence doubles only after a monster is frozen.
- Lead with [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] on low-HP targets – the kill refunds mana and draws a card for every hero, fueling the rest of the turn.
- Use [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip] once it hits 1 or 0 mana to finish chunky enemies or strip block without exhausting your freeze tools.
- [`Zap`][card-zap] handles unfrozen waves; try to finish with [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm] so the next turn opens with frozen enemies ready for bolts.
- Co-op: call out frozen targets so teammates delay AOE until after you fire double-damage bolts.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Study | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm] ×2 | 1 / Common | `Study` `-` | Freeze setup | Cheap, reliable freeze every turn. |
| [`Snowball`][card-snowball] | 1 / Rare | `Study` `-` | Bolt amplifier | Doubles bolt damage vs frozen enemies; exhausts. |
| [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] | 1 / Rare | `Study` `-` | Primary payoff | Refunds mana + draws on kill; aim at frozen low-HP targets. |
| [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip] | 2 → 0 / Common | `Study` `-` | Follow-up damage | Cost drops after kills; great mid-turn finisher. |
| [`Subzero`][card-subzero] | 2 / Legendary | `Study` `-` | Scaling influence | Adds +2 bolt damage per stack and double damage to frozen foes. |
| [`Weave Laylines`][card-weave-laylines] | 0 / Legendary | `Study` `-` | Team battery | +5 mana + draw 2 for all heroes; exhaust. |
| [`Rune of Ice`][card-rune-of-ice] | 1 / Rare | `Study` `-` | AOE freeze | Medium-radius freeze for setting up Snowball turns. |
| [`Zap`][card-zap] | 2 / Rare | `Study` `-` | Wide clear | Sweeps unfrozen trash; plan mana around repeated casts. |
| Flex slot 1 | Varies | – | Influence | [`Lie in Wait`][card-lie-in-wait], `Arcane Repository`, or other scroll/draw tech as needed. |
| Flex slot 2 | Varies | – | Control | [`Chilly Blow`][card-chilly-blow], `Shield Scroll`, or movement tech depending on map/event needs. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt]: 3 base damage → 6 with [`Snowball`][card-snowball] vs frozen target; lethal on 6-HP trash refunds mana + draws.
- [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip]: 6 base damage, dropping to 1 mana after a kill and 0 after the second; with [`Snowball`][card-snowball], frozen enemies take 12.
- [`Zap`][card-zap]: 5/4/3/2 damage chain; combo with freeze to soften groups before bolt finishers.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Feed gems to the Mage until [`Snowball`][card-snowball] (1 gem) and [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] are secured; afterwards the build funds itself via refunds.
- Coordinate freeze windows so allies hold AOE until after your bolts fire – double damage ends fights faster than raw team damage.
- For bosses, keep one freeze source in reserve to reset after thaw; [`Rune of Ice`][card-rune-of-ice] + [`Subzero`][card-subzero] ensures your burst stays lethal.

## Common Pitfalls
- Playing [`Snowball`][card-snowball] with no frozen enemy wastes the influence; always freeze first.
- Letting allies thaw enemies prematurely – communicate and lead with bolts before physical AOE.
- Overspending gems at Vaults before locking in freeze tools; without [`Snowball`][card-snowball], damage output drops drastically.
