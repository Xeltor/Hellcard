# Mage Snowball Bolt Battery (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: freeze priority enemies, then double bolt damage with `Snowball`/`Subzero` while recycling mana through `Harpoon Bolt` kills.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
- **Difficulty**: Medium (10/15) – sequencing around freeze matters, but securing `Snowball` keeps the 12-floor run stable.
- **Best in**: mid/back row in solo or co-op; shines at clearing wide boards while feeding allies mana and cards.
- **Key stats**: a frozen target turns `Harpoon Bolt` into a 1-mana payoff that refunds mana + party draw; `Fractal Whip` drops to 0-cost after two kills, letting you chain bursts.

## Core Loop
1. Apply freeze with `Cold Arm`/`Rune of Ice` and bank the debuff using minimal mana.[4][7]
2. Drop `Snowball` (or `Subzero`) so bolts deal 2× damage into frozen targets, then fire `Harpoon Bolt` and `Fractal Whip` for efficient clears.[1][2][3][5]
3. Use the mana/card refunds from `Harpoon Bolt` and `Weave Laylines` to reset your hand, repeat freezes, and keep the team topped off.[3][6]

## Draft Priorities
- **Freeze sources**: `Cold Arm` → `Rune of Ice` → `Chilly Blow`; take `Eternal Winter` later as an emergency panic button.[4][7][8][9]
- **Bolt payoffs**: `Snowball` is mandatory; add `Subzero` for scaling and `Harpoon Bolt` for refunds.[1][2][3][5]
- **Sustain tools**: `Fractal Whip` for cycling damage and `Weave Laylines` for 0-cost team refuel.[6][10]
- **Utility**: pick up one large AOE (`Zap`) for unfrozen trash and consider `Brutal Thaw` from artifacts to capitalize on freeze explosions.[11]
- **Removals**: trim starting `Magic Bolt` once you have better bolt density to avoid whiff draws.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: first upgrade goes to `Harpoon Bolt` (increases damage to secure kills) or `Fractal Whip` (drops kill threshold for the cost reduction).[3][5]
- **Hideout**: remove filler, use **Plan** to pin `Snowball` or `Cold Arm`, and gift spare gems if the Mage is carrying Snowball scaling alone.[12]
- **Vaults**: only detour once `Snowball` is online; losing gem tempo early delays the influence purchase that makes the build work.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Hat` – cheaply adds `Fractal Whip`, giving you a dependable bolt payoff.[13]
- `Cockade` – injects `Cold Arm` and `Brutal Thaw`, covering both freeze application and detonation.[14]
- `Acorn` – rewards triple-bolt turns with 10 block, protecting the Mage while combos loop.[15]
- `Silver Spoon` / `Clam` – early gem economy still matters; grab one to fund upgrades and influence purchases.[16][17]
- Support relics like `Spacious Sleeve` or `Little Helper` are optional; use them if you need extra scroll/card flow but prioritise freeze/burst artifacts first.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Cast freeze before `Snowball`; the influence doubles only after a monster is frozen.[1][4]
- Lead with `Harpoon Bolt` on low-HP targets – the kill refunds mana and draws a card for every hero, fueling the rest of the turn.[5]
- Use `Fractal Whip` once it hits 1 or 0 mana to finish chunky enemies or strip block without exhausting your freeze tools.[3]
- `Zap` handles unfrozen waves; try to finish with `Cold Arm` so the next turn opens with frozen enemies ready for bolts.[7][11]
- Co-op: call out frozen targets so teammates delay AOE until after you fire double-damage bolts.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Study | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Cold Arm` ×2 | 1 / Common | `Study` `-` | Freeze setup | Cheap, reliable freeze every turn.[4] |
| `Snowball` | 1 / Rare | `Study` `-` | Bolt amplifier | Doubles bolt damage vs frozen enemies; exhausts.[1] |
| `Harpoon Bolt` | 1 / Rare | `Study` `-` | Primary payoff | Refunds mana + draws on kill; aim at frozen low-HP targets.[5] |
| `Fractal Whip` | 2 → 0 / Common | `Study` `-` | Follow-up damage | Cost drops after kills; great mid-turn finisher.[3] |
| `Subzero` | 2 / Legendary | `Study` `-` | Scaling influence | Adds +2 bolt damage per stack and double damage to frozen foes.[2] |
| `Weave Laylines` | 0 / Legendary | `Study` `-` | Team battery | +5 mana + draw 2 for all heroes; exhaust.[6] |
| `Rune of Ice` | 1 / Rare | `Study` `-` | AOE freeze | Medium-radius freeze for setting up Snowball turns.[7] |
| `Zap` | 2 / Rare | `Study` `-` | Wide clear | Sweeps unfrozen trash; plan mana around repeated casts.[11] |
| Flex slot 1 | Varies | – | Influence | `Lie in Wait`, `Arcane Repository`, or other scroll/draw tech as needed.[18] |
| Flex slot 2 | Varies | – | Control | `Chilly Blow`, `Shield Scroll`, or movement tech depending on map/event needs.[8] |

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Harpoon Bolt`: 3 base damage → 6 with `Snowball` vs frozen target; lethal on 6-HP trash refunds mana + draws.[1][5]
- `Fractal Whip`: 6 base damage, dropping to 1 mana after a kill and 0 after the second; with `Snowball`, frozen enemies take 12.[3]
- `Zap`: 5/4/3/2 damage chain; combo with freeze to soften groups before bolt finishers.[11]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Feed gems to the Mage until `Snowball` (1 gem) and `Harpoon Bolt` are secured; afterwards the build funds itself via refunds.
- Coordinate freeze windows so allies hold AOE until after your bolts fire – double damage ends fights faster than raw team damage.
- For bosses, keep one freeze source in reserve to reset after thaw; `Rune of Ice` + `Subzero` ensures your burst stays lethal.

## Common Pitfalls
- Playing `Snowball` with no frozen enemy wastes the influence; always freeze first.[1][4]
- Letting allies thaw enemies prematurely – communicate and lead with bolts before physical AOE.
- Overspending gems at Vaults before locking in freeze tools; without `Snowball`, damage output drops drastically.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
