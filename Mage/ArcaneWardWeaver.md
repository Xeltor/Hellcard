# Mage Arcane Ward Weaver (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: layer shields (`Scroll of Wall`, `Warding Glyph`, `Barrier Orb`) while retaliating with unblockable spells (`Volcanic Lightning`, `Bolt Hell`).
- **Difficulty**: High (12/15) – juggling mana and ward timers across 12 floors requires precise sequencing, but payoffs let you tank entire waves while burning them down.
- **Best in**: frontline spell-tank role; ideal when your team needs a hybrid defensive caster.
- **Key stats**: upgraded `Scroll of Wall` plus `Barrier Orb` deliver 15+ block per turn, while `Volcanic Lightning` and `Bolt Hell` convert stored mana into lethal bursts.[1][2][3]

## Core Loop
1. Generate defensive scrolls with `Unpack the Bag`, `Paper Library`, and `Barrier Orb` to keep block stacked.[1][2][4]
2. Spend leftover mana on heavy bolts (`Volcanic Lightning`, `Bolt Hell`, `Harpoon Bolt`) so kills feed further resources.[3][5]
3. Repeat: ward first, then attack—your goal is to end fights with full block so the next floor starts safe.

## Draft Priorities
- **Ward engines**: `Unpack the Bag`, `Barrier Orb`, `Scroll of Wall`, `Warding Glyph` (from events) keep block coming.[1][4][6]
- **Damage**: `Volcanic Lightning`, `Bolt Hell`, `Fractal Whip` for targeted finishing; `Harpoon Bolt` refunds mana on kills.[3][5][7][8]
- **Support**: `Weave Laylines`, `Paper Library`, `Power is Knowledge` ensure you never run dry on scrolls or mana.[2][9]
- **Utility**: `Cold Arm` or `Chilly Blow` freeze elites so your wards aren’t chipped away.[10][11]
- **Removals**: drop starter `Magic Bolt` once bolt suite online; you want high-impact spells only.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Barrier Orb` (more block + scroll refund) and `Volcanic Lightning`; follow with `Harpoon Bolt` for reliable kill refunds.[3][5][7]
- **Hideout**: remove filler, Plan `Unpack the Bag`, and invest gems until you grab scroll/ward artifacts (`Spacious Sleeve`, `Hat`).[12]
- **Vaults**: visit when you want specific artifacts like `Brilliance` or `Wizard Focus` from events.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Spacious Sleeve` – ensures a free scroll every turn, critical for defense loops.[12]
- `Hat` – adds `Fractal Whip`, giving you a reusable follow-up to bolt kills.[8]
- `Cockade` – provides `Cold Arm` and `Brutal Thaw`, assisting with freeze control to preserve wards.[10]
- `Fruits of Labor` – rewards ending turns with no mana, synergizing with scrolls that refund resources.[13]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Always play ward scrolls before damage; you want to start enemy turns with 10+ block when possible.[1]
- Use `Volcanic Lightning` on near enemies while `Scroll of Wall` covers your allies; follow with `Harpoon Bolt` to refund mana if the target dies.[3][7]
- `Bolt Hell` is your finisher after multiples have been weakened; time it when adds drop in to avoid Strain on `Lightning`.
- Keep track of Strain spells (Lightning variants); rotate between `Volcanic Lightning`, `Fractal Whip`, and bolts to avoid running out of mana.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Study | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Unpack the Bag` ×2 | 1 / Common | Scroll supply | Provides Wall/Mind/Wisdom each turn.[1]
| `Barrier Orb` | 1 / Rare | Ward engine | Generates block and returns a scroll.[4]
| `Weave Laylines` | 0 / Legendary | Refuel | Resets mana and draw after big turns.[2]
| `Volcanic Lightning` | 1 / Common | Single-target + Arcane Stupor | Great against armored foes.[3]
| `Bolt Hell` | 1 / Legendary | Board clear | Draws and heals on multi-kills; use as finisher.[5]
| `Harpoon Bolt` | 1 / Rare | Refund | Ensures mana profit on kills.[7]
| `Fractal Whip` | 2 / Common | Finisher | Cost drops after kills; good against durable enemies.[8]
| `Cold Arm` | 1 / Common | Freeze setup | Preserves wards; upgrade for reliability.[10]
| Flex slot | — | Utility | `Power is Knowledge`, `Chilly Blow`, or scroll duplication depending on drops.[9][11]

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Volcanic Lightning` hits for 6 + Arcane Stupor debuff; with `Fruits of Labor` you can chain two per turn.[3][13]
- `Bolt Hell` can draw 3+ cards in one cast when it wipes a wave, reloading your hand for the next floor.[5]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Announce ward rotations so allies know when it’s safe to overextend; you can soak multi-hit bosses comfortably if scrolls are ready.
- Use `Cold Arm` before ally burst windows to ensure freezes or Stupors stick.
- Keep `Weave Laylines` for boss thresholds; dropping to zero mana after a burst still nets you the Fruits bonus next turn.

## Common Pitfalls
- Casting bolts before setting wards—always build block first or you’ll take lethal chip damage.
- Letting `Volcanic Lightning` Strain stack; alternate spells to maintain mana.
- Forgetting to cleanse Arcane Stupor (from Volcanic Lightning) by planning your next draws; keep scrolls ready to refill.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
