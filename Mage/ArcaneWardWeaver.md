# Mage Arcane Ward Weaver (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: layer shields (`Scroll of Wall`, [`Warding Glyph`][card-warding-glyph], [`Barrier Orb`][card-barrier-orb]) while retaliating with unblockable spells ([`Volcanic Lightning`][card-volcanic-lightning], [`Bolt Hell`][card-bolt-hell]).
- **Difficulty**: High (12/15) – juggling mana and ward timers across 12 floors requires precise sequencing, but payoffs let you tank entire waves while burning them down.
- **Best in**: frontline spell-tank role; ideal when your team needs a hybrid defensive caster.
- **Key stats**: upgraded `Scroll of Wall` plus [`Barrier Orb`][card-barrier-orb] deliver 15+ block per turn, while [`Volcanic Lightning`][card-volcanic-lightning] and [`Bolt Hell`][card-bolt-hell] convert stored mana into lethal bursts.

## Core Loop
1. Generate defensive scrolls with [`Unpack the Bag`][card-unpack-the-bag], [`Paper Library`][card-paper-library], and [`Barrier Orb`][card-barrier-orb] to keep block stacked.
2. Spend leftover mana on heavy bolts ([`Volcanic Lightning`][card-volcanic-lightning], [`Bolt Hell`][card-bolt-hell], [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt]) so kills feed further resources.
3. Repeat: ward first, then attack—your goal is to end fights with full block so the next floor starts safe.

## Draft Priorities
- **Ward engines**: [`Unpack the Bag`][card-unpack-the-bag], [`Barrier Orb`][card-barrier-orb], `Scroll of Wall`, [`Warding Glyph`][card-warding-glyph] (from events) keep block coming.
- **Damage**: [`Volcanic Lightning`][card-volcanic-lightning], [`Bolt Hell`][card-bolt-hell], [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip] for targeted finishing; [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] refunds mana on kills.
- **Support**: `Weave Laylines`, [`Paper Library`][card-paper-library], [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge] ensure you never run dry on scrolls or mana.
- **Utility**: [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm] or [`Chilly Blow`][card-chilly-blow] freeze elites so your wards aren’t chipped away.
- **Removals**: drop starter `Magic Bolt` once bolt suite online; you want high-impact spells only.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Barrier Orb`][card-barrier-orb] (more block + scroll refund) and [`Volcanic Lightning`][card-volcanic-lightning]; follow with [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] for reliable kill refunds.
- **Hideout**: remove filler, Plan [`Unpack the Bag`][card-unpack-the-bag], and invest gems until you grab scroll/ward artifacts (`Spacious Sleeve`, `Hat`).
- **Vaults**: visit when you want specific artifacts like `Brilliance` or `Wizard Focus` from events.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Spacious Sleeve` – ensures a free scroll every turn, critical for defense loops.
- `Hat` – adds [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip], giving you a reusable follow-up to bolt kills.
- `Cockade` – provides [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm] and `Brutal Thaw`, assisting with freeze control to preserve wards.
- [`Fruits of Labor`][card-fruits-of-labor] – rewards ending turns with no mana, synergizing with scrolls that refund resources.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Always play ward scrolls before damage; you want to start enemy turns with 10+ block when possible.
- Use [`Volcanic Lightning`][card-volcanic-lightning] on near enemies while `Scroll of Wall` covers your allies; follow with [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] to refund mana if the target dies.
- [`Bolt Hell`][card-bolt-hell] is your finisher after multiples have been weakened; time it when adds drop in to avoid Strain on `Lightning`.
- Keep track of Strain spells (Lightning variants); rotate between [`Volcanic Lightning`][card-volcanic-lightning], [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip], and bolts to avoid running out of mana.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Study | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Unpack the Bag`][card-unpack-the-bag] ×2 | 1 / Common | Scroll supply | Provides Wall/Mind/Wisdom each turn.
| [`Barrier Orb`][card-barrier-orb] | 1 / Rare | Ward engine | Generates block and returns a scroll.
| `Weave Laylines` | 0 / Legendary | Refuel | Resets mana and draw after big turns.
| [`Volcanic Lightning`][card-volcanic-lightning] | 1 / Common | Single-target + Arcane Stupor | Great against armored foes.
| [`Bolt Hell`][card-bolt-hell] | 1 / Legendary | Board clear | Draws and heals on multi-kills; use as finisher.
| [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] | 1 / Rare | Refund | Ensures mana profit on kills.
| [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip] | 2 / Common | Finisher | Cost drops after kills; good against durable enemies.
| [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm] | 1 / Common | Freeze setup | Preserves wards; upgrade for reliability.
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge], [`Chilly Blow`][card-chilly-blow], or scroll duplication depending on drops.

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Volcanic Lightning`][card-volcanic-lightning] hits for 6 + Arcane Stupor debuff; with [`Fruits of Labor`][card-fruits-of-labor] you can chain two per turn.
- [`Bolt Hell`][card-bolt-hell] can draw 3+ cards in one cast when it wipes a wave, reloading your hand for the next floor.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Announce ward rotations so allies know when it’s safe to overextend; you can soak multi-hit bosses comfortably if scrolls are ready.
- Use [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm] before ally burst windows to ensure freezes or Stupors stick.
- Keep `Weave Laylines` for boss thresholds; dropping to zero mana after a burst still nets you the Fruits bonus next turn.

## Common Pitfalls
- Casting bolts before setting wards—always build block first or you’ll take lethal chip damage.
- Letting [`Volcanic Lightning`][card-volcanic-lightning] Strain stack; alternate spells to maintain mana.
- Forgetting to cleanse Arcane Stupor (from Volcanic Lightning) by planning your next draws; keep scrolls ready to refill.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
