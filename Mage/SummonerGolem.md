# Mage Summoner Golem Conductor (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: cycle summon spells (`Maelstrom`, `Rune of Ice`, `Summon Golem` line) to lock lanes while `Cold Arm`/`Fire Trap` style bolts finish targets.[1][2][3]
- **Difficulty**: Medium (9/15) – managing summon timers is easy, but pacing mana so summons are always active across all 12 floors needs attention.
- **Best in**: backline support; summons tank hits while allies stay safe.
- **Key stats**: `Maelstrom` deals 15 damage + freeze; with `Brilliance` contraptions or scroll support, you can stun entire waves every few turns.

## Core Loop
1. Keep at least one summon on the board (`Maelstrom`, `Rune of Ice` freeze golems) to control enemy movement.[1][2]
2. Follow with bolts (`Harpoon Bolt`, `Fractal Whip`) to pick off frozen/stunned enemies and trigger mana refunds.[3][4]
3. Refresh summons each turn, stacking control effects so enemies rarely act.

## Draft Priorities
- **Summon core**: `Maelstrom`, `Rune of Ice`, `Summon Golem` variants; grab `Weave Laylines` to refuel after big turns.[1][2][5]
- **Control**: `Cold Arm`, `Chilly Blow`, `Eternal Winter` extend freeze windows for summons to capitalize.[6][7]
- **Damage**: `Harpoon Bolt`, `Fractal Whip`, `Hearteater Bolt` secure kills once freezes land.[3][4][8]
- **Support**: `Power is Knowledge` or scroll packages provide mana/draw to keep summons cycling.[9]
- **Removals**: trim basic `Magic Bolt` once summon/damage core is online.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade `Maelstrom`/`Rune of Ice` first for larger freeze/damage; follow with `Harpoon Bolt`.[1][2][3]
- **Hideout**: remove filler, Plan `Rune of Ice`, and invest gems until you can snag supportive artifacts (`Spacious Sleeve`, `Hat`).[10]
- **Vaults**: optional—take them if you need relics like `Brilliance` to double-control; otherwise focus on consistent upgrades.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Spacious Sleeve` – feeds scrolls to keep mana flowing for summon turns.[10]
- `Hat` – adds `Fractal Whip`, giving reliable follow-up damage to frozen enemies.[11]
- `Cockade` – provides `Cold Arm` and `Brutal Thaw`, great for freeze detonations.[12]
- `Silver Spoon` – early gem injection for upgrades.[13]

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Cast summons before control spells; `Maelstrom` adds a freeze and damage, so follow with bolts for kill-secure.[1][3]
- Use `Cold Arm` to set up `Fractal Whip` or `Harpoon Bolt`; the freeze ensures bolt damage doubles or refunds mana.[6][3]
- Keep track of summon exhaustion—if `Maelstrom` has fired, recast before enemies get a turn.
- In co-op, communicate freeze windows so allies hold AOEs until after they proc.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Study | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Maelstrom` | 1 / Rare | Summon AOE | Freeze + 15 damage sweeps waves.[1]
| `Rune of Ice` | 1 / Rare | Summon freeze | Keeps lanes locked while golems swing.[2]
| `Harpoon Bolt` | 1 / Rare | Kill refund | Mana + draw on kill; best finisher.[3]
| `Fractal Whip` | 2 / Common | Finisher | Cost drops after kills; perfect post-freeze.[4]
| `Cold Arm` | 1 / Common | Cheap freeze | Use before bolts to double damage.[6]
| `Chilly Blow` | 2 / Rare | Wide freeze | Great for elite/boss setups.[7]
| `Weave Laylines` | 0 / Legendary | Team battery | Resets mana/draw after summon turns.[5]
| Flex slots | — | Utility | `Power is Knowledge`, `Brilliance`, or scroll support to keep engine humming.[9]

## Damage Benchmarks
- `Maelstrom` + `Fractal Whip` deals 21+ damage (15 AoE + 6 whip), enough to clear Floor 8 waves.[1][4]
- `Harpoon Bolt` refunds mana + draw on kill, letting you chain into another summon or bolt each turn.[3]

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Place summons in lanes allies leave open; they act as blockers while teammates reposition.
- During boss adds, lead with `Maelstrom` to freeze the pack, giving allies free crowd control.
- Keep `Weave Laylines` for threshold turns so you can reset after a big summon cycle.[5]

## Common Pitfalls
- Letting summons expire—refresh them before enemy phases or you’ll take chip damage.
- Overcommitting mana to bolts; always leave 1–2 for emergency freezes (`Cold Arm`).
- Failing to upgrade; base summons plateau without Armory investment.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
