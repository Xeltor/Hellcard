# Mage Summoner Golem Conductor (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: cycle summon spells ([`Maelstrom`][card-maelstrom], [`Rune of Ice`][card-rune-of-ice], `Summon Golem` line) to lock lanes while [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm]/`Fire Trap` style bolts finish targets.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (9/15) – managing summon timers is easy, but pacing mana so summons are always active across all 12 floors needs attention.
- **Best in**: backline support; summons tank hits while allies stay safe.
- **Key stats**: [`Maelstrom`][card-maelstrom] deals 15 damage + freeze; with `Brilliance` contraptions or scroll support, you can stun entire waves every few turns.

## Core Loop
1. Keep at least one summon on the board ([`Maelstrom`][card-maelstrom], [`Rune of Ice`][card-rune-of-ice] freeze golems) to control enemy movement.
2. Follow with bolts ([`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt], [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip]) to pick off frozen/stunned enemies and trigger mana refunds.
3. Refresh summons each turn, stacking control effects so enemies rarely act.

## Draft Priorities
- **Summon core**: [`Maelstrom`][card-maelstrom], [`Rune of Ice`][card-rune-of-ice], `Summon Golem` variants; grab [`Weave Laylines`][card-weave-laylines] to refuel after big turns.
- **Control**: [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm], [`Chilly Blow`][card-chilly-blow], `Eternal Winter` extend freeze windows for summons to capitalize.
- **Damage**: [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt], [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip], [`Hearteater Bolt`][card-hearteater-bolt] secure kills once freezes land.
- **Support**: [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge] or scroll packages provide mana/draw to keep summons cycling.
- **Removals**: trim basic `Magic Bolt` once summon/damage core is online.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Maelstrom`][card-maelstrom]/[`Rune of Ice`][card-rune-of-ice] first for larger freeze/damage; follow with [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt].
- **Hideout**: remove filler, Plan [`Rune of Ice`][card-rune-of-ice], and invest gems until you can snag supportive artifacts (`Spacious Sleeve`, [`Hat`][card-hat]).
- **Vaults**: optional—take them if you need relics like `Brilliance` to double-control; otherwise focus on consistent upgrades.

## Artifacts & Relics
- `Spacious Sleeve` – feeds scrolls to keep mana flowing for summon turns.
- [`Hat`][card-hat] – adds [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip], giving reliable follow-up damage to frozen enemies.
- [`Cockade`][card-cockade] – provides [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm] and `Brutal Thaw`, great for freeze detonations.
- [`Silver Spoon`][card-silver-spoon] – early gem injection for upgrades.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Cast summons before control spells; [`Maelstrom`][card-maelstrom] adds a freeze and damage, so follow with bolts for kill-secure.
- Use [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm] to set up [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip] or [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt]; the freeze ensures bolt damage doubles or refunds mana.
- Keep track of summon exhaustion—if [`Maelstrom`][card-maelstrom] has fired, recast before enemies get a turn.
- In co-op, communicate freeze windows so allies hold AOEs until after they proc.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Study | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Maelstrom`][card-maelstrom] | 1 / Rare | Summon AOE | Freeze + 15 damage sweeps waves.
| [`Rune of Ice`][card-rune-of-ice] | 1 / Rare | Summon freeze | Keeps lanes locked while golems swing.
| [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] | 1 / Rare | Kill refund | Mana + draw on kill; best finisher.
| [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip] | 2 / Common | Finisher | Cost drops after kills; perfect post-freeze.
| [`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm] | 1 / Common | Cheap freeze | Use before bolts to double damage.
| [`Chilly Blow`][card-chilly-blow] | 2 / Rare | Wide freeze | Great for elite/boss setups.
| [`Weave Laylines`][card-weave-laylines] | 0 / Legendary | Team battery | Resets mana/draw after summon turns.
| Flex slots | — | Utility | [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge], `Brilliance`, or scroll support to keep engine humming.

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Maelstrom`][card-maelstrom] + [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip] deals 21+ damage (15 AoE + 6 whip), enough to clear Floor 8 waves.
- [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] refunds mana + draw on kill, letting you chain into another summon or bolt each turn.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Place summons in lanes allies leave open; they act as blockers while teammates reposition.
- During boss adds, lead with [`Maelstrom`][card-maelstrom] to freeze the pack, giving allies free crowd control.
- Keep [`Weave Laylines`][card-weave-laylines] for threshold turns so you can reset after a big summon cycle.

## Common Pitfalls
- Letting summons expire—refresh them before enemy phases or you’ll take chip damage.
- Overcommitting mana to bolts; always leave 1–2 for emergency freezes ([`Cold Arm`][card-cold-arm]).
- Failing to upgrade; base summons plateau without Armory investment.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
