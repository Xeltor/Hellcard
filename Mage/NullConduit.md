# Mage Null Conduit Absorber (Updated: October 2024 live build)

## One-Screen Summary
- **Win condition**: funnel damage into mana via [`Channel Pain`][card-channel-pain], [`Iron Will`][card-iron-will], and [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge], then convert that mana into bolts ([`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt], [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip]) and shields ([`Mana Shield`][card-mana-shield]).
- **Difficulty**: Medium (10/15) – tanky playstyle with a few rares; success depends on timing your absorptions.
- **Best in**: co-op backline; excels when allies feed you hits for refund value.
- **Key stats**: [`Channel Pain`][card-channel-pain] gives 2 mana whenever you take 4+ damage, and upgraded [`Iron Will`][card-iron-will] adds 6 block plus mana when your armor holds.

## Core Loop
1. Establish defenses with [`Mana Shield`][card-mana-shield], [`Iron Will`][card-iron-will], and [`Ethereal Shield`][card-ethereal-shield] so incoming hits trigger refunds without killing you.
2. Cast [`Channel Pain`][card-channel-pain] and [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge] to convert damage into mana.
3. Spend refunds on [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt], [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip], and [`Bolt Dance`][card-bolt-dance], leveraging extra mana from the absorption engine.

## Draft Priorities
- **Absorption tools**: [`Channel Pain`][card-channel-pain], [`Iron Will`][card-iron-will], [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge], [`Arcane Wager`][card-arcane-wager]; upgrade [`Channel Pain`][card-channel-pain] first.
- **Payoffs**: [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt], [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip], [`Bolt Dance`][card-bolt-dance] and [`Weave Laylines`][card-weave-laylines] to keep hand flowing.
- **Support**: [`Mana Shield`][card-mana-shield], [`Ethereal Shield`][card-ethereal-shield], [`Triage`][card-triage] to cover turns when refunds lag.
- **Removals**: cut fragile bolts; you want reliable spells that benefit from surge mana.

## Map & Economy Routing
- **Armory**: upgrade [`Channel Pain`][card-channel-pain], then [`Iron Will`][card-iron-will]; [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] third for bigger kills.
- **Hideout**: Plan [`Channel Pain`][card-channel-pain], remove low-impact scrolls, and purchase artifacts that reward mana ([`Conduit Aura`][card-conduit-aura], [`Flux`][card-flux]).
- **Vaults**: optional but strong—legendary shields like [`Final Word`][card-final-word] make you unbreakable.

## Artifacts & Relics
- [`Conduit Aura`][card-conduit-aura] – mana refunds stack with [`Channel Pain`][card-channel-pain] loops.
- [`Flux`][card-flux] – reduces cooldown on scrolls so you reapply shields faster.
- [`Cocoa Mug`][card-cocoa-mug] – sustain your HP while you intentionally soak damage.
- [`Book Cover`][card-book-cover] – adds block on spell play, synergising with Iron Will turns.

## Sequencing & Combat Micro
- Cast [`Channel Pain`][card-channel-pain] early in the turn; you want its trigger active before enemies hit.
- Layer [`Mana Shield`][card-mana-shield] and [`Iron Will`][card-iron-will] together—one absorbs, the other refunds mana.
- Spend extra mana immediately; holding it wastes potential if you cap out.
- Co-op: signal allies when you can tank big hits so they reposition accordingly.

## Sample Deck Shell / Flex Slots
| Card | Cost / Rarity | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Channel Pain`][card-channel-pain] ×2 | 1 / Rare | Mana refund | Upgrade for higher refund threshold. |
| [`Iron Will`][card-iron-will] ×2 | 1 / Common | Block + mana | Adds block while refunding mana. |
| [`Power is Knowledge`][card-power-is-knowledge] | 2 / Rare | Discount | Converts stored mana into cheap spells. |
| [`Mana Shield`][card-mana-shield] | 1 / Common | Defense | Core safety net. |
| [`Ethereal Shield`][card-ethereal-shield] | 1 / Rare | Team protection | Shares block with allies. |
| [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] | 1 / Rare | Damage + draw | Spends refunded mana efficiently. |
| [`Fractal Whip`][card-fractal-whip] | 1 / Rare | Reusable damage | Drops to 0 after kills. |
| [`Bolt Dance`][card-bolt-dance] | 2 / Rare | Mana sink | Great once refunds stack. |
| Flex slot | — | Utility | [`Weave Laylines`][card-weave-laylines], [`Arcane Wager`][card-arcane-wager], or artifact scrolls as needed. |

## Damage Benchmarks
- [`Channel Pain`][card-channel-pain] proc + [`Harpoon Bolt`][card-harpoon-bolt] nets +3 mana and clears 8 HP targets.
- Double [`Iron Will`][card-iron-will] stacks 12 block and 2 mana refunds, enough for [`Bolt Dance`][card-bolt-dance] follow-up.

## Co-op & Boss Notes
- Volunteer to absorb multi-hit boss attacks; your refunds fuel the party’s next turn.
- Keep [`Ethereal Shield`][card-ethereal-shield] ready if allies can’t block a big hit—you still gain mana from the shared shield.
- Bosses with DoTs require extra healing; grab [`Cocoa Mug`][card-cocoa-mug] or [`Triage`][card-triage] early.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to cast [`Channel Pain`][card-channel-pain] before damage arrives—timing is mandatory.
- Overspending HP; even with refunds you must maintain shields.
- Sitting on mana; spend it each turn to avoid overcapping.

## Changelog
- 2025-03-02 – Initial release (Codex).
